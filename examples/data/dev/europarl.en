Mr President, the old monopolies are no longer up to providing the efficient service which we have all come to regard as a right.
The scale of the mismanagement has been extensively documented, first and foremost through the Court of Auditors' investigations, and most recently in the report from our Committee on Budgetary Control (the BÃ¶sch report).
This is the manner in which the Luxembourg Socialists will approach any other moves towards liberalisation on the part of the Commission.
The central issues must therefore be to guarantee the continuation of the exclusive national use of the territorial waters within the twelve-mile limit, and even to consider whether it needs to be extended and to guarantee the continuation of the international fisheries agreements.
Recent events in China have also given rise to serious concerns related to respect for human rights.
I would like to go further than that. The provision of a universal service can ultimately be a logical result and product of liberalisation.
It is not just the U.S who are supporting NATO expansion with the primary aim of finding new markets for their weapons, EU weapons producing countries are taking the same approach.
Firstly, we should not tread more carefully than the Commission here.
Thirdly, we must create and maintain a viable context for the electronic market, as it is an area that employs a lot of people in Europe.
Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Commission to give impetus to policies which come under the third pillar, and therefore cannot take a favourable decision on this.
Mr President, that is why we should vote for this report.
It is the presidency's intention - and this forms part of the EU initiative that the UK, France and Germany jointly put forward - that we work towards that conference with the aim of establishing stability, security and cooperation throughout the Balkan region.
That is a fallacy.
I call on all Irish MEPs to support socio-economic provisions along with public liability.
Madam President, I had not intended to intervene but some of the questions that have been raised here and in the debate are based, perhaps, on a certain misunderstanding.
The new tachograph will clearly help, but until then this idea will only cause problems.
So the key point is that in pursuing the one aim, we do not neglect the other, and above all that we ensure not only that the development of research, particularly in the field of leading-edge technology, benefits the poorer regions directly but also that exchanges of researchers, which will be supported under the fifth framework R&D programme, can be used to promote innovation in the structurally weaker regions.
The dangers may become real, even without giving way to gloom-mongering.
But the text also goes beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This technology is available now. It is our duty in the quest for improved public health to put it to use.
We have spent the last three or four years talking about cutting back on spending at European level, freezing the budget and maintaining the present rate of spending.
I hope he will do that.
It is clear that a postponement is important in order to stop extreme elements from gaining the upper hand in the Israeli elections.
Participation in this programme will also be open to the countries belonging to the European Economic Area, as well as the countries involved in negotiations to accede to the European Union.
As for the request for a roll-call vote, on the other hand, I have just been made aware of this.
Mr President, the idea behind giving aid to improve the safety of nuclear power stations in the applicant countries has always been that they should be shut down completely in the long term.
I therefore welcome the Schwaiger report for its practical and critical attitude and also for its endeavours to help people in specific ways and to consolidate administration and the rule of law, without which there will be fresh waves of refugees, and the return of refugees and all the reconstruction work we have done, of which many are justifiably so proud, will immediately come under threat if the highly fragile peace there is destroyed.
Mr President, as the House will appreciate, we are dealing here with a very serious matter, namely KEDO and relations with North Korea, a country which is totally isolated at present and which is in the grip of acute food shortages.
It will mean transparency. It will mean a procedure for operations so that all the requirements are attainable.
We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising, and in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments.
You know that pasture land is also one of the economically marginalised areas.
Allow me nevertheless to make one or two points.
We are therefore able to accept the amendments which Mr Blokland and Mr Eisma in particular underlined as important for their positions.
To put it simply, we know that peace will not be obtained at any cost.
The problem is how to force this man to accept a solution, a reasonable solution, after ten years have gone by.
I would like to emphasise the importance of how investment in sustainable development is implemented in practice and monitored.
The Commission is obviously trying to be fairly straightforward here.
I too am all for fair competition between individual modes of transport and for fair and efficient pricing of transport services.
This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs, which I can only put down to huge self-interest, and I hope that the large coalitions which put protecting the Commission before Parliament's right of control have learnt from the events of the past months and will be more loyal to Parliament than their Commissioners in the future.
That will not be very easy; indeed we have already discussed in the committee several times how this is to be achieved.
Mr Ephremidis would like to speak on the Balkans, but the debate on Kosovo is to take place this afternoon; I think he will have an opportunity to comment then.
However, it will be necessary to improve the judicial system, the public administration, the police forces and the regional authorities through training, support for reforms, the reinforcement of relations between the European and Russian political systems and support for the NGOs and for an independent press.
Simple rejection by Parliament when we are opposed to a text instead of a two-phased rejection is now possible under the Amsterdam Treaty - simpler, easier and puts Parliament in a stronger position.
Madam President, I was not aware of that.
At a time when Europe is looking for its soul and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, is telling us that we will find it in American culture, I wonder if we might not be able to generate a little enthusiasm among the people of Europe by allowing them to do something exciting that forms part of their culture, in other words, demonstrate solidarity in fighting for human rights across borders.
Let us hope that action will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.
We will not waste any time on considering and weighing up each of the measures, which are more or less welcome, that are contained in the general regulation.
The EU must get closer to the people in its activities, raising its profile among passing trade, as it were, and the Expo is an ideal forum for this.
I do not consider that a secret ballot.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, repairing the dramatic material and, above all, moral consequences of the Kosovo drama, collaborating with the International Criminal Court so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished, laying down the foundations for the economic development of the area so as to promote reconciliation between the Kosovan Albanian and Serbian populations, must be matters of the utmost priority for the European Union.
This is why I, like many of my colleagues, feel that we must set up a Temporary Committee of Enquiry on the dioxin crisis.
As the British Government addresses the final details on this issue, it should be remembered that there is no safe level of radiation.
We have also heard from each Member of the Commission that the Commission will be getting leaders in each field who have committed themselves to working more closely with Parliament.
There will be a lot of talking and a lot of self-congratulation, as we have seen some Members doing already - and I am sorry that Mr Schulz dropped the debate in the end by leaving the sitting - but I would like to say that perhaps this Parliament should look into democracy in its own house.
Mr President, it is not in a spirit of sterile recrimination but because of our concern and alarm about the way the situation is now developing that we feel compelled to recall and stress the direct and indirect responsibility of the United States of America for the massacres, the ethnic cleansing, going on unabated at this very moment in East Timor.
Therefore, you are not allowed to intervene on behalf of a group which does not exist.
The result of yesterday' s referendum gives us cause to rejoice, along with the people of Algeria, who are on the road to reconciliation and striving to achieve peace in their country.
This is the real cause of the problems we are experiencing.
To claim that the liberalisation of trade is a priori favourable to development certainly adheres to the creed of globalisation which is holding sway everywhere, but reality continually shows these allegations to be false.
They are not saying a word about the dangerous polarisation between state and society, whilst at the same time, the gulf between rich and poor is widening. The aforementioned industrialists are endeavouring to defuse this explosive situation by calling for people to join forces for a civilian society.
That does not mean that we cannot quickly garner the first agreements as they come to ripeness.
Mr President, we most certainly like to receive information.
Firstly, through OLAF, the Protocol on privileges and immunities which gives this Parliament and its work special protection, will not be abrogated.
And we want the Member States to confront these exceptional circumstances, and the reconstruction of Kosovo is an exceptional circumstance, with exceptional solutions which must not be sought by means of a simple across-the-board cut imposed on Parliament in their lines and programmes.
There must be a critical mass of donors who are willing and able to make a more long-term effort in a given country, so coordination is extremely important here.
But our fundamental position is that as a general rule we ought not to do so, particularly now that we have a European Works Council whose responsibility it is to solve these types of problem.
I would hope that since a significant proportion of that is public funding - taxpayer's money - the ownership of new procedures can remain with the public sector and be made available cheaply to the people who really need it most.
Only it is also important to know when such a delegation will be going and who is going with it.
It is extremely regrettable that the agency has entered into a number of private employment agreements outside the rules on inviting tenders.
We have to realise that those ecstasy tablets are responsible for a great deal of senseless nightlife violence.
Similarly, one particularly positive point of the directive is that the rights of the members of the reunited family are defined, rights relating to education and employment, in order both to ensure that they are smoothly integrated into the society of the Member State and to safeguard their employment rights, so that they do not turn into cheap labour on the job market.
And a word to the Greek Presidency, given that we all agree it is the element of civilisation that unites us in Europe.
As I said earlier, ladies and gentlemen, these are both points noted in the Morillon report and aims of the presidency and that is why we are making an effort to promote them.
The donor must be protected in every case, and his or her rights must be respected.
They literally cannot wash their hands of this matter now.
This is a question of compliance by just one Member State with existing postal arrangements.
Now there is once again great disagreement about the way in which we should tackle liability.
