Lastly, since more than one 3G modem can be connected to the router and the Zeroshell <i>Net Balancer</i> module is used, settings can be created to balance connections on several operators and with Failover.

One of the most dangerous navigation traps is called <i>Phishing</i>.
Simply use the two DNS, <i>208.67.222.222</i> and <i>208.67.220.220</i> to use OpenDNS to improve response time and fight Phishing without any other worries.
In addition to controlling content using the default categories, you can setup your own <i>blacklist</i> and <i>whitelist</i> to block or permit access to certain sites.
Remember that statistics must be activated on the dashboard following <a href="http://www.opendns.com" target="_blank">OpenDNS</a> registration.
Another possibility, if you have a DNS server on your LAN, it to have the server work as a DNS cache set to use OpenDNS as <i>Forwarders</i> to resolve any non authoritative domain.
This way, when the client response is not in the LAN DNS cache, forwards the request to the OpenDNS server instead of <i>ROOT DNS</i>.
To set up the Zeroshell DNS server as described to use OpenDNS as forwarders, simply display the  [DNS][Forwarders] section and update services with IP 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 separated by a comma and specifying <i>ANY</i> as the domain.
To set it, simply select <i>OpenDNS</i> as the domain in the [DNS][Dynamic DNS] section (as illustrated above), enter your OpenDNS account username and password and activate the service.
This block should be set in the <i>FORWARD</i> chain to process router traffic.

When the SRTC system receives the request associated with one of the previous services, it sends a similar request via BIP to OPSC to enable (ABILITA_ <span> ROAM) </span> , or disable international <span> </span> roaming <span> </span> (DISAB_ <span> ROAM </span> ).
The OPSC then notifies ( <span> NOTIFIC_ROAM </span> ) execution of the service requested by BIP. This generates a <span> EVNOATTI </span> or <span> EVNODISA </span> notification event, which InfoBus manages by forwarding a notification to SID.

<a> The main objective of Memopal is to guarantee a high level of security for its users' data.
<a> The data structure containing links between the files and the owner is also encrypted.
<a> Memopal works well with firewalls because it uses the same protocol as the user to view websites (HTTP and HTTPS protocol) and is thus compatible with firewalls and proxies.
These services concern the activation ( <span> BANKATTI) </span> and deactivation <span> </span> ( <span> BANKDISA </span> ) of the Bankamatic-POS service.

<span> VERUTESYNC </span> is an alternative version of the <span> VERUTE </span> service, and can be invoked in synchronous / synchronous mode.
If the outcome of the <span> VERUTE </span> service is positive, the BIP system sends the recharge request to OPSC (via an asynchronous <span> RICARICA </span> service).
In turn, OPSC sends the recharge notification to BIP, via the asynchronous <span> NOTIRICA </span> service.
This generates different notification events, depending on whether the user has a TACS ( <span> EVNORI_T </span> ) or GSM ( <span> EVNORI_G </span> ) account.
InfoBus manages these events by forwarding an equal number of notifications, <span> NOTIRI_T </span> and <span> NOTIRI_G </span> , to the SID system.
The outcome of the recharge service is then sent to the SID system via the <span> ESIRICSI </span> service.

The corresponding services used to activate and deactivate domiciliation are <span> DOMIATTI </span> and <span> DOMIDISA. </span>
When InfoBus receives a reply from OPSC, it forwards this response to BIP and generates a <span> COMMIT </span> event towards the OPSC.
OPSC automatically disables domiciliation towards BIP using the <span> REVODOMI </span> service. The service is asynchronous without response.
The BIP system uses the <span> ANAPREP </span> service to check the existence of registration data for all recharge processes towards the OPSC system.
At this point BIP uses the <span> VERUTE </span> service (verify account), to check whether the user can recharge their card. The service is call-back/synchronous.

The SRTC system, through BIP, sends a request to OPSC to enable ( <span> ROAMABIL </span> ), or disable roaming <span> </span> ( <span> ROAMDISA </span> ). It does this by calling the relevant service.
The OPSC then notifies ( <span> NOTIROAM </span> ) execution of the service that was requested by BIP; this generates a <span> EVNOABRO </span> or <span> EVNODIRO </span> notification event, which InfoBus manages by forwarding an equal number of notifications to the NAT system, <span> NOTIABRO </span> or <span> NOTIDIRO </span> .

The log messages are produced by the subsystems <span> ToInfobusEJB </span> (for data inbound to InfoBus, outbound from J2EE System) and <span> FromInfobusEJB </span> (for data outbound from InfoBus, inbound to J2EE System).
The trace levels used by the monitoring log messages (that is, class ‘ <span> MON </span> ’), will use a range of values separate from those of all other classes.
Tracing log messages of various levels and class ‘ <span> MON </span> ’ is guided by the environment variable <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> .
if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has not been defined, no ‘ <span> MON </span> ’ class message will be issued.
The environment variable <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> is added to the one that already exists ( <span> TRCAPP_LOGINIT </span> ), which continues to guide the tracing of the log messages of all other classes.
<span> <modulo> </span> is the InfoBUS module running the log
<span> yyyymmgg </span> is the log date (year, month and day)
<span> nnnnnn </span> is a sequential counter, which goes up each time the file reaches the maximum size and a new file is created.
if the environment variable <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> is not set, the log files will not be split by size and their name will not include the sequential number. Instead, they will have the following format:
If the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable is defined (and therefore the log messages are activated, see paragraph 5), regardless of how the <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> variable is set, the changing of the log file by a process is indicated with a monitoring message at INFO level, according to the following format:
log time and date expressed as <span> yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.mmmmmm </span> (year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds)
the switch message is not run if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has not been defined.
if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has been defined, the switch message is run, regardless of the <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> variable.

A Workflow process always starts with a <span> GEN </span> type activity (request generation).
<span> Platform independence </span> due to the use of Java 1.5 as the programming language (all the NetX system modules run on both Windows and UNIX-like environments).
<span> Compliance with the latest system monitoring standards </span> due to the implementation of WMI technologies (Windows) and WBEM (UNIX-like).
<span> Use of SSH, RSH and Telnet </span> protocols for the remote connection to UNIX-like systems, if interaction using the standard WBEM is not possible.
<span> Communication transparency between system modules </span> guaranteed by the implementation of SOAP protocol on HTTP/HTTPS, including its use in sub-networks connected via Firewall.
<span> Standard managed communication security </span> guaranteed by the implementation of HTTPS SSL2 protocol with a 128 bit session key.
<span> Very low organisational impact </span> when introducing the infrastructure to pre-existing environments.
As we have said, to define a Logical function, select a <span> Physical Function </span> from those provided by the system and set some function parameters.

It is in fact evident, where BSS and Web operate in a very uncoupled manner, the main points of contact are on-line <span> (rather than off-line </span> – <span> ETL), and which are therefore driven by TIBCO </span> .
<span> On the basis of these considerations and the fact that the synergy of possible efforts were in substance already realized during 2003 and the beginning of 2004, Accenture-HP propose the dimensioning of the entire area, which results in a further 10-20% of efficiency (the average effort in </span> <span> overtime </span> <span> in the previous contract); this objective is possible due to the mix of skills achieved (to be improved, but substantially efficient) and the fact that the key people will be confirmed if the contract is reassigned to Accenture-HP. </span>

If a pop-up appears with msg <span> Couldn </span> ’ <span> t open SNMP, </span> verify the name of the device is correct.
The users management window <span> User Administration </span> will appear.
<span> click on the symbol below the column Modify/Delete relating to the user to be deleted to remove </span> it <span> . </span>
expand the folder <span> User Accounts </span> <span> and click on </span> <span> Users </span> <span> . </span>
Setting <span> </span> the <span> ISAdministrator </span> field may or may not determine the visibility of the Administration field, and thus the possibility of performing user management, for example.
We advise you to do this using ReportBuilder (launched using the <span> builder </span> command on Web-Access Server) by selecting File <a> Deploy and logging in with the web profile on which the deploy is to be performed.
To add a new web user, expand the <span> User Accounts folder </span> <span> and click on </span> <span> Users </span> <span> . </span>
Select <span> Add New User </span> and having compiled the fields of the form, click on <span> Apply </span> to save the new user settings.
For user management you must access the <span> Web-Access Server </span> ( <a> ), logging in with the <span> trendadm </span> system user <span> (or as another user with web administration privileges) </span> and select <span> Administration </span> in the Navigation Frame; the items allowing changes to OVPI parameters appear in the tree structure positioned on the left:
If you must manually insert one or more devices on a Performance Monitoring system satellite, as illustrated in <a> , <span> </span> it is <span> </span> good practice to verify SNMP reachability before forcing the discovery with the command <span> trend_discover </span> – <span> t </span> – <span> E. </span> An excellent SNMP reachability test method is to use the MIBbrowser which is accessed, as described in <span> . </span>
<span> Tools </span> <span> Change Node </span> select the node from the pull-down menu which you wish to query, select the MIB/s you wish to query in the tree on the right and launch the get from
<span> Tools </span> <span> SNMP Tools </span> <span> Get </span> and await the results.
A simple verification method is to select the device/s on which verification is to be carried out using the form offered by the Snapshot reports as DeviceResource <a> Device <a> NRT Device Snapshot and Interface_Reporting <a> Interface <a> NRT Snapshot and verify the collection.
Select the item <span> Catalog </span> in the Navigation Frame to view the list of various report types developed after the collection of data available to us.
The most useful reports are those relating to so-called <span> Near Real Time </span> as they provide data for the last six hours.
<span> /sbin/init.d </span> <span> <process name> </span> <span> stop </span> to stop
The standard method of collecting data involves the verification, within reporting, of the status of the reports containing the device on which verification <span> </span> is <span> </span> to <span> </span> be <span> </span> carried <span> </span> out.
Access the <span> Web Access Server </span> ( <a> ), logging in with your <span> </span> own <span> </span> user <span> . </span>
under the directory <span> /OVPI/sbin/init.d </span>
If you have to manage <span> </span> a process, using the <span> trendadm </span> system <span> </span> user, perform the following commands:
<span> /sbin/init.d </span> <span> <process name> </span> <span> start </span> to start
Once manual insertion of the new devices is complete and you are logged in as trendadm, launch the command <span> trend_discover </span> – <span> t </span> – <span> E </span> from the command line to enable the collection of information on newly introduced devices to begin.
This command is also conveniently launched from the graphic interface in the pull-down menu in <span> Tools </span> <span> Type Discovery. </span>
Figure <a> 2:
select the node and click on <span> Delete </span> to cancel it and confirm its deletion.
On the left hand side of the tree menu, click on <span> Polling Policies </span> which allows you to view all information relating to the current polling policies:
in the Polling Policy Manager window, select <span> Edit </span> <span> Nodes </span> for the <span> Edit Nodes </span> window to appear
click on the <span> Create </span> button to insert a new node ( <span> Edit </span> to modify)
fill in the fields of the Create Node window by inserting the name of the node ( <span> Node Name </span> ), the <span> SNMP profile </span> of the node (Create to build one), the <span> Community String Profile </span> (the community profile used at present for the device currently on the network does not correspond to a unique <span> standard </span> ), the <span> Status </span> (by inserting <span> Available </span> to enable the node for polling) <span> Snmpv1 Node </span> and <span> Snmpv2 </span> ; to conclude click OK.
<span> In other words only if </span> <span> there is not enough time in regards to the resolution of the identified problem </span> <span> , as indicated in the following paragraph </span> “ <span> 15.4.7 Duration of the System Integration Test </span> ” <span> . </span>
<span> All the approval tests </span> <span> effectively carried out give a positive result ( see </span>

This type of discovery is not used <span> </span> in Powertrain as the nodes are imported using the graphic interface or using an appropriately formatted text file, as described in the following paragraph.
The <span> File </span> menu <span> </span> allows you to logout and close the Performance Manager window ( <span> Exit </span> item).
You must use the exit <span> options </span> to correctly close the graphic interface to avoid leaving the processes hanging, which would reduce the performance of the system.
The <span> Tools </span> menu allows access to the <span> MIBbrowser </span> (accessible from the web access server machine), which views <span> all </span> MIBs using a tree structure and allows you to query them.
From the MIB browser window, using <span> File </span> <span> Open </span> <span> LoadMIB, </span> you can load various MIBs to be queried (and for possible use to create ad hoc datapipes).
The <span> Help </span> menu provides information on the version used by OVPI and allows you to navigate the product Help pages.
The <span> Tools </span> menu allows access to the <span> Package Manager </span> which is the tool used to manage the installation or removal of packages using follow-on screens.
<span> The installation phase allows you to deploy reports which are predefined by the report pack (or the publication of same for consultation purposes via the web or report viewer) and to undeploy reports (remove reports) during the uninstall phase. </span> <span> </span>
The <span> Tools </span> menu allows access to the window relating to the SNMP-discovery which permits a nodes search on the network using a range of IP addresses.
The latter can be performed by command line (using <span> ReportViewer </span> ) <span> </span> or via web.
<span> OVPI is managed using a graphic interface which is accessible only to the </span> <span> trendadm </span> <span> user, the product administrator. </span> <span> </span>
A graphic emulator is required (Reflection, Exceed etc) to correctly view the OVPI application interface. It is therefore <span> necessary </span> to configure monitor settings to <span> 256 colors </span> .
To launch the graphic interface, login to the system as the <span> trendadm </span> user, <span> </span> export the display and launch the <span> piadmin& </span> command:

<span> Methodological approach </span> The methodological approach proposed by HP to deal with the implementation of the proposed project is based on a simple series of points and rules to be followed; we explain the most important below:
<span> Define realistic objectives, balancing time, costs and functionality </span> The functional and temporal objectives must be tuned to define and design a realistic plan to activate the systems.
<span> Use of its structure </span> Each workgroup must be capable of easily using all the structures and know-how of its company, to easily and rapidly find the necessary information and assistance, when requested.
The folders called “Budget approved <aaaa>” and included in the Corporate (ICT Trenitalia) folders, will be subject to a standard SAP EP approval workflow, for the first step of which the approver is the manager of ICT System Management.

On completion of the agreed intervention, <span> all the user mailboxes that haven't taken user action will be blocked from sending mails and accessing Internet </span> .
The guarantee includes <span> Best Effort </span> intervention to resolve possible anomalies/problems.
It is important to note that while the migration tasks for e-mail boxes is an easily controllable process, even centrally controlled, <span> the insertion tasks for the workstations onto the new domain and the updating of the profile and activation of the account require administration access on the workstation </span> .
<span> <span> <span> <span> <span> General Info </span> <span> 2 </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>
We would like to thank you for your collaboration and remind you that already at the end of the procedure you can immediately avail of the <span> 50MB </span> <span> mail </span> <span> box </span> and that in the coming days you can avail of the new <span> via web mail </span> service (Outlook web access), the new <span> anti-spam service </span> and <span> dedicated internet access </span> (as soon as it is available).
<a> <a> <span> 1) Who are the Migration Team? </span> <a> .
Ensure you <span> ALWAYS </span> access your PC using the FIATAUTO domain.
<a> <a> <a> 2) I would like more information.

In this case, <span> tasks are performed using a script provided by HP. </span>
By selecting “ <span> Yes </span> ” the .NET Framework 1.1 will automatically install on your PC (if previous versions of .NET Framework are present they will not be altered).
<a> <a> <a> 7) When I try to access the page http://www.fiatauto.com/migrazione I cannot connect or I get an error.
What should I do? <a> <a> .
You can <span> manually intervene </span> on these PCs to reconfigure the network parameters:
<a> <a> <a> 8) Click on “Check” doesn't work.
The activities scheduled for the <span> ANALYSIS </span> phase include:
<span> <span> <span> 9) Having started the procedure I get an error message relating to network problems (for example, the message contains a “network error …”) </span> <span> 3 </span> </span> </span>
It is not possible on these workstations to run scripts that were created for migration and it is therefore necessary to <span> manually intervene </span> to:
These PCs follow the <span> migration process piloted directly by HP and the end user </span> , which has already been used successfully for Italian Central Bodies.
It is necessary on these settings to <span> manually intervene to deactivate the application </span> which is blocking the scripts from functioning.
This category of workstations <span> can also be managed remotely by staff possessing the right administrative credentials. </span>
<span> PC in domain with administrative use common to all PCs </span> (the classic case of the Administrator or equivalent of the domain which is inserted in the Domain Admins group, a group which in turn is inserted in the local administrators group present on all PCs);
<span> PC in domain or workgroup with local administrative use </span> (this can be virtually common to all PCs if the local administrator user has the same password for all PCs).
In this case, <span> the activities can be manually performed </span> , exactly as for PCs with Windows NT4 <span> or using a script provided by HP </span> .
Once your PC has re-started, access it using your user, new password and <span> FIATAUTO </span> domain.
From now on you can no longer use your old user name on the old domain (ITALY1, ITALY2, local user), but <span> ALWAYS </span> use the new user with the new password.
The “ <span> Messages Viewer </span> ” provides you with the necessary instructions to continue with the procedure.
At this point you have the possibility to press “ <span> Next </span> ” to continue with the procedure or press “Cancel” to postpone the operation.
By pressing “ <span> Next </span> ” the following screen appears:
On doing so, press the “ <span> Start </span> ” button.
Reinsert your password and press “ <span> Start </span> ”.
The next window will allow you to set your new password on the <span> FIATAUTO </span> domain.

<a> <a> 1) Who are the Migration Team? </a> </a> <a>
<span> If you require further information relating to migration procedures, you can contact us at <a> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <a>  . </span>
<span> 3) What happens when I perform the preparation procedure (click on </span> “ <span> Check </span> ” <span> )? </span>
<span> From Outlook select Contacts > with the right button select Proprieties > </span> “ <span> Outlook Address Book </span> ” <span> > activate the flag </span> “ <span> Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book </span> ” <span> . </span>
<span> The preparation procedure to migration, which is activated by clicking on the “Check” button on the web page, </span> <a> enables the technical migration of the new services.
Furthermore, it can prevent potential inconveniences that could arise after the e-mail service migration. <a>
<a> 4) What does NOT happen when I perform the preparation procedure?
<a> 5) What happens if I cannot click before March 31st?
<a> Starting from the <a> 31st March <a> the e-mail service will be migrated.
If this does not work, ask the user on what share server they operate and inform <a> of this information, asking them to check if these servers are already in trust with FIATAUTO
If you do not perform the procedure, on first access to Outlook after service migration, you could encounter some problems such as: <a>
<span> No Outlook connection to mail server </span> <span> </span>
A <span> REGEDIT /S </span> command is launched to import some registry keys which enable the component installation path to be redirected.
“ <span> Attention! </span>
At the same time, an <span> ok.mig </span> file is created in the position <span> %USERPROFILE% </span> on the user PC.
<span> ProfileImagePath </span> (new user on FIATAUTO) <span> = %USERPROFILE% </span> (old user profile path)
To avoid this type of problem during the migration procedure, if intercepted, the installation of the SystemIpdate component in the PC redirects the installation path to the server <a> where the file SystemUpdate.msi is found.
<a> 6) How do I know if the procedure was successful?
First you run the <span> UNAS </span> command <span> </span> to start a new user profile.
Notify <a> of the manual intervention to enable complete registration of the operation.
<a> 7) When I try to access the page </a> <a> <a> http://www.fiatauto.com/migrazione </a> <a> </a> </a> <a> I cannot connect or get an error.
<span> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DisableDynamicUpdate=0 </span>   <span> ( </span> if not already updated, the dns dynamic update is enabled)
<a> <a> 9) Having started the procedure I get an error message relating to network problems (for example, the message contains a “network error …”) </a> </a> <span> </span>
<a> The preparation procedure is non invasive and will not modify any settings on your computer.
If you feel you need technical support, you can contact us on 119970 (199 619970 external). <a>
<a> The preparation procedure is non invasive and will not modify any settings on your computer.
<a> <a> 12) Selecting from the Address Book I can no longer see my “Personal contacts” </a> </a> <span> </span> .
In the first case notify <a> of the problem and wait for confirmation that the problem has been resolved. Then ask the user to restart the procedure.
In the second case, remind the user to read the user’s manual available on <a> and ask them to restart the procedure.
<a> Following the preparation for migration, which is activated by clicking on the “Check” button of the web page, the necessary technical checks will be activated.
Continue to access and use your mail as before. <a>
<a> 14) Following e-mail migration, will all the new services be operational?
<a> No, some functionalities will be available only after workstation migration, which will follow that of e-mail.
This operation is carried out by reading the attribute <span> mDBOverQuotaLimit </span> .
<span> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\SyncDomainWithMembership=1 </span>  (enable use of the domain extension as a dns extension)
When you have migrated, you will receive notification of same and the access methods to the new services. <a> <a>
<a> 15) What should I do to migrate my e-mail?
<a> Nothing.
<a> 19) When will my mailbox become at least 50 MB?
Following migration, if the user complains that on each logon a setup starts that regularly fails, it is enough to tell the user (or personally intervene) to modify the installation path <a> and click OK.
Your collaboration is requested only to activate the preparation procedure, following which the necessary technical checks will activate. <a>
<a> 16) Following e-mail migration, will my GAL (Address Book) data be modified?
<a> No.
<span> You must inform the user to wait for the problem to be solved and notify the mailbox </span> <span> of this problem. </span>
Migration will not modify any local or PC data or data on the Global Access List. <a>
<a> 17) Will my e-mail authentication method change?
<a name="_Toc130973127"> </a> <a name="_Toc129779804"> </a> <a name="_Toc129773841"> </a> <a name="_Toc129773954"> </a> <span lang=IT> 19) When will my mailbox become at least 50 MB?
<a> This new functionality will be available only after workstation migration, which will follow that of e-mail.
<a> 20) How can I access my post via web with the new Outlook Web Access?
The post-processing script is found in the folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\weblogging on the ITTRN1S3MIGR02 server and called XMLAnalyzer.exe   <span> By connecting to the aforementioned site (accessible to everyone) it is possible to support the users who call with procedure execution problems. </span>
<a> 21) What e-mail boxes will be migrated?
The <span> MBX_Logging </span> folder deals with the logs of users who "click".
What should I do? <a> <a> <a> .
<a> Perform the procedure.
<username>_<computername>_<data>_<ora>.xml
<a> where you can select by day the workstations to migrate.
<span> If </span> <span> </span> <a> your Outlook is configured with a default profile this profile will not be inconvenienced after migration.
The search is carried out on the entire <span> fiatauto.adfa.local </span> field.
If you have a default profile which is not configured among your profiles and you don't know how to configure it, contact us at <a> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <a> . <a>
<span> In this case it is important that you notify us of your configuration at </span> <a> <a> <span> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <span> </span> </span> <span> to avoid any problems with the service after migration. </span>
On termination of the copy, the <span> DetectFramework.vbs </span> script is run which has the task of checking the presence of .NET Framework 1.1 on the WKS to migrate.
On completion of the check, the script runs the migration procedure by launching the executable <span> HPMigrationTool.exe </span>    <span> An </span> “ <span> Impossible to run HPMigrationTool.exe </span> ” <span> or </span> “ <span> DLL not found </span> ” <span> type error or an error explaining why the user cannot see the main procedure screen means there is a problem with the .NET Framework. </span>
The procedure writes each executable operation on a log file which is locally created on the user's PC and on its completion it is placed on share <a> where it is processed by the post-processing script.
<a> POP3/IMAP4 Server:
<ERR>User doesn't have admin permission</ERR>

Also in this case, as with the file share, collect info on the application in question and send it to <a>
<a> SMTP Server:
The <span> WKS_Migration </span> folder is where the log files relating to users who want to carry out a workstation move are copied.
The <span> WKS_Completed </span> folder is where log files relating to users who successfully migrated their workstations are moved.
If you wish to block the migration procedure for a user, you must at least know his or her USERID, find it in the <span> WKS_Migration folder on one of the three OWA01, 02, 03 servers </span> (<userID>_<computerName>.xml format) and cancel this file.
The file <span> download.bat </span> is run and copies the entire <span> wks </span> folder on the client of the PC in the position:
If you wish to block the migration procedure for a user, you must at least know his or her USERID, find it in the {\b WKS_Migration folder on one of the three OWA01, 02, 03 servers } (<userID>_<computerName>.xml format) and cancel this file.

<log>--------------------------</log>
In case of failure, it is necessary to manually intervene by logging on to the workstation using the user credentials on the old domain and insert the new user (FIATAUTO\<userID>) on the local admins.
You must remove the file <userID>_<workstationName>.xml from the folder WKS_Migration from one of the servers OWA01, 02, 03. A problem of this type could be when the user calls to complain that on each logon a pop-up appears that says:

Simply use the two DNS, <span> 208.67.222.222 </span> and <span> 208.67.220.220 </span> to use OpenDNS to improve response time and fight Phishing without any other worries.

<a> <span> Dmailer distributes its local backup product on 30M USB pens per year. </span>
Remember that statistics must be activated on the dashboard following <span> OpenDNS </span> registration.
Another possibility, if you have a DNS server on your LAN, it to have the server work as a DNS cache set to use OpenDNS as <span> Forwarders </span> to resolve any non authoritative domain.
This way, when the client response is not in the LAN DNS cache, forwards the request to the OpenDNS server instead of <span> ROOT DNS </span> .
To set up the Zeroshell DNS server as described to use OpenDNS as forwarders, simply display the [DNS][Forwarders] section and update services with IP 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 separated by a comma and specifying <span> ANY </span> as the domain.
To set it, simply select <span> OpenDNS </span> as the domain in the [DNS][Dynamic DNS] section (as illustrated above), enter your OpenDNS account username and password and activate the service.
This block should be set in the <span> FORWARD </span> chain to process router traffic.

<span> Coherently with this approach, it is possible to reach greater savings (25%) within each lot </span> , in respect of those achieved within each area (10%).
<span> Minimum sub-lot </span> (e.g. CRM1 environment test):
the value of the FTEs inserted in the cells of the total sub-lots per area, at a single lot level, is inferior to the sum of each cell at a minimum sub-lot level, since we have included synergy determined by the possibility of efficiency on the service management and on the continuous coverage (7 x24) activities, as well as scaled savings on the larger volumes; the unitary rates remain the same as those scheduled at a minimum sub-lot level <span> 44 </span> .
<span> Total sub-lots per BSS area and Web/lot </span> (e.g. total 1+2 per test):
therefore the total indicated for BSS + WEB for the Deployment and <span> Maintenance lots is valid only if the Tibco side is awarded to Accenture-HP; if, on the contrary, the sums of the single lots will be valid </span> ; the unitary rates are however reduced in respect to those scheduled at a minimum sub-lot and area level.
<span> Total sub-lots per Web area and Telco/lot </span> (e.g. total 2+3 for test):
<span> Total per lot </span> (e.g. total 1+2+3 for test):
<span> Total sub-lots per service </span> (e.g. test, deployment and maintenance of the CRM1 service):
<span> Total per area </span> (e.g. test, deployment and maintenance per BSS area):
<span> Total BSS and Web area </span> (e.g. test, deployment and maintenance of the BSS+Web area):
<span> Total BSS+Web area </span> <span> (test, deployment and maintenance of the Web+Telco area): </span> the value of the FTEs inserted in the cells of the total Web+Telco areas are equal to the sum of the same regroupings scheduled at lot level, while the unitary rates are reduced in respect to those scheduled at area level and in respect to those scheduled for the same regroupings at a single lot level.
(test, deployment and maintenance of the <span> BSS+Web+Telco areas): The value of the FTEs inserted in the cells of the total is equal to the sum of the same regroupings scheduled at total level for the three lots, while the unitary rates are further reduced in respect to those scheduled at area regrouping level and those scheduled at a single lot level </span> .

Accenture-HP in the CM process environment and already involved in the provision of this service in their independent components of Accenture and HP, have highlighted the areas for improvement, such as <span> : </span>
Accenture-HP, in virtue of recent experience in H3G, has acquired excellent knowledge of these activities and considers itself capable of providing an appropriate contribution to this environment <span> . </span>
Both the companies guarantee in-depth know-how of specific technologies used in this environment and a complete and recognized command of the methodologies and operational processes that are the basis of the software lifecycle <span> . </span>
the production, maintenance and distribution of the Configuration Management Plan; tracking of the SW product versions <span> (major and minor releases), management of the configuration of machines used for the build, release of the build to the test group and interfacing with the development team, management of release back-ups, management of the release notes and the documentation associated with each release. </span>
Through the definition of a CM process which adapts to the necessity of the customer's business, the use of detailed procedures and appropriate support tools <span> , it was possible to obtain notable results for the business, such as the reduction of operational costs for the development and deployment management of new services, a quick time-to-market and service differentiation, an increase in customer satisfaction using </span> SLAs for the management of service quality and a quick ROI.
The skills necessary for Configuration Management and Support Tool activities to be provided by Accenture-HP <span> are suitable to those requested in the application for the H3G Application Management tender, both concerning technical skills and the professional profile. </span>
<span> These presentations provide an introduction and a description of the application in question (or the new release </span> ) and of its main characteristics, focusing on the functional and operational aspects that are relevant to the end users (the technical and architectural aspects are only compared if relevant to the comprehension of the user system).
<span> When a training environment is unavailable for the application in question, the presentations are supplied with screenshots of the application and with guided navigation </span> .
Update of training material on the application (CC Profiles and Dealers) relating to the new releases scheduled in the roll-out (01/05/2004) to 31/12/2004 <span> 38 </span> among which:
<span> for the ESSPRIT Project </span> <span> Toll Manufacturing Agreement </span> <span> </span>
<span> A distinguishing factor that re-enforces the aforementioned points can be found in HP </span> ’ <span> s ability to respect, and in part, improve solution release timeframes, as well as the knowledge that HP, </span> <span> for a critical factor such as Change Management, can dedicate particular attention both in terms of the </span> <span> process, providing experienced resources to address the most organizational aspects, and in terms of user training, which will impact </span> <span> during </span> <span> the deployment of the solution. The latter will have a dedicated team of people who are focused on conducting the necessary cultural change to ensure the success of the project. </span>
<span> The intrinsic value of HP is also that of directing a skilled project team who have proven experience in similar projects in the past in structures such as the HP Invent Center in Dubai and the HP Competence Center in Bangalore (India) where HP develop state of the art </span> <span> activities </span> <span> in technological and project environments relevant to this tender, such as the definition of prototypes, feasibility studies and project completion. </span>

EABMQ <span> . </span>
<span> E </span> Link <span> A </span> dapter for <span> BMQ </span> .
Tuxedo Service or, more simply, <span> Service </span>
This is the service invoked by the client with the <span> tpcall </span> or <span> tpacall </span> <span> </span> <span> tpacall </span> <span> </span> (for example <span> EABMQSend </span> , <span> EABMQReceive </span> ).
BMQ Service or, more simply, <span> Operation </span>
The operation that must be run by the invoked Tuxedo service (for example “ <span> RICARICA </span> ”, “ <span> VERIFICA_UTENZA </span> ”).
EABMQ uses the <span> libBmqo </span> object library to perform this function, which exports the BMQ functions as high level services and, in turn, uses the <span> TimBmqLib </span> (vers.
The behaviour of the adapter is guided by the parameters specified in the Tuxedo ( <span> ubbconfig </span> ) and library configuration files (or db).
The Tuxedo user can invoke a <span> send </span> service instead of a <span> receive </span> or <span> request-reply </span> , without having to worry about low-level programming or the functioning of the BMQ itself.
The adapter’s functioning is based on the ‘ <span> Service </span> ’ concept - just like the object library it uses - which is a series of activities that carry out a precise function (send, receive, reply...).
To avoid confusion, from now on ‘ <span> service </span> ’ means the Tuxedo service and ‘ <span> operation </span> ’ means the requested BMQ service.
The client invokes the Tuxedo service (in the previous example, <span> EABMQSend </span> ) published by the adapter server in the BBL, and transfers a FML31 buffer as a parameter containing, among other things, the name of the requested operation ( <span> RICARICA </span> ).
At this point, the EABMQ adapter can extract the information from its repository needed to carry out the operation using the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
The communication protocol between any Tuxedo client and the EABMQ adapter foresees the use of Tuxedo’s standard interface. Therefore, the services published by the adapter itself are invoked by the client with a <span> tpcall </span> (synchronous call) or a <span> tpacall </span> (asynchronous call).
To install the adapter, you need to create a user account in the target machine with the following characteristics, dedicated to InfoBus. <span> This will be the sole administrator </span> :
“ <span> $HOME/infobus </span> ” (the structure of this directory is described later);
When the account has been created, log in to the system as “ <span> infobus </span> ” and, from the home directory, run the “ <span> EA_install </span> ” script provided with the installation package.
<span> FLDTBLDIR32 </span> = path for the FML32 file.
Must be set with the complete path of the FML32 files ( <span> /home/infobus/EABMQ/fml </span> ).
<span> FIELDTBLS32 </span> = the name of the FML32 file which will be used ( <span> EABMQ.fml32 </span> , I <span> nfobus.fml32 </span> ) by the adapter.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGDIR </span> = path for the trace of the adapter.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGINIT= </span> trace level of the adapter.
<span> TIMBMQ_LOGDIR </span> = path for the trace of the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGDIR </span> ).
<span> TIMBMQ_LOGINIT= </span> trace level of the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
In the directory containing the environment files (( <span> /home/infobus/EABMQ/env </span> ) there is a script ( <span> eabmq.env </span> ) that sets the aforementioned environment variables.
configuration of the BMQ library <span> libBmqoo.sl </span> for <span> </span> operations the adapter must carry out, and configuration of the Tuxedo services for the adapter itself.
The <span> libBmqoo.sl </span> object library reads the services configured in a repository that can consist of an Oracle database or a file in XML format (in the latter case, the DTD will be provided by the InfoBus group).
BMQ queue name (the name of the queue or the destination (receipt) BMQ binomial (“ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
Alternative response queue (the name of the queue or the binomial “ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
Notification queue name (the name of the queue or the binomial “ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
See the previous paragraph for BMQ library configuration. ( <a> ).
For configuration of a Tuxedo service with the <span> ubbconfig </span> file, see the documentation provided with the product.
As there are two Tuxedo servers relating to the adapter (one publishing the <span> EABMQSend </span> , <span> EABMQReply </span> , <span> EABMQReqReply </span> services, and the other publishing the <span> EABMQReceive </span> service) there should be at least two “ <span> entries </span> ” in the configuration file.
The services of the EABMQ adapter must be configured in the Tuxedo configuration file ( <span> ubbconfig </span> ).
In the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section of the Tuxedo configuration file, specify the groups to which the services belong.
<span> EABMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> gives <span> </span> the name of the group relating to services published by <span> EABMQServices </span> ;
<span> EABMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> gives <span> </span> the name of the group relating to services published by <span> EABMQReceive </span> ;
<span> GROUP_No </span> is the numeric identifier assigned to that group.
In the “ <span> *SERVERS </span> ” section, specify the parameters relating to the services themselves, following this format:
<span> EABMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> and <span> EABMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> <span> </span> have the same meaning and value described for the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section;
<span> ID_SERVER </span> is the order number of the server within the group;
<span> X </span> specifies the configuration read type (‘1’ = from database, ‘2’ = from XML file);
<span> CONNECT_STR </span> is the database connection string or the path of the XML configuration file for the library;
<span> only for </span> <span> EABMQReceive </span> :
<span> CALL_TYPE </span> specifies the call type when invoking the Tuxedo service that will manage the received message.
Possible values are ‘ <span> C </span> ’, which indicates a <span> tpcall </span> and ‘ <span> Q </span> ’, which indicates a <span> tpenqueue </span> ;
<span> TUXEDO_SRVC </span> is the name of the Tuxedo service to invoke (see
<span> CALL_TYPE </span> );
<span> QUEUE_SPACE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> for /Q queues;
<span> READ_SRVC </span> is the name of the BMQ read service (this must match one of the services configured for the BMQ library);
<span> ERR_QUEUE </span> gives the name of the /Q error queue in which messages that have been read and not delivered to the management Tuxedo will be put (see
<span> TUXEDO_SRVC </span> );
<span> -L </span> is an optional parameter, without topic, which, if present, tells the EABMQReceive to run an infinite cycle of reads from the BMQ.
To configure /Q, a <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> must be defined, the name of which will correspond with the one defined for the “ <span> -Q </span> ” in the <span> CLOPT </span> of the <span> EABMQReceive </span> service.
This <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> will contain the queues used by the service, and the error queue used to manage messages not received by the management Tuxedo service, defined by the “ <span> -E </span> ” parameter, always present in the <span> CLOPT </span> of the same service.
This error queue must be created in the indicated <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> .
To declare the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> , you need to define the following in the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section of the Tuxedo configuration file.
<span> QUEUE_SPACE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> containing the /Q queues to be used;
<span> PATH_QDEVICE </span> is the path of the <span> QUEUE DEVICE </span> ;
<span> DEVICE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE DEVICE </span> .
<span> SRVC_QUEUE </span> is the name of the queue, which must be the same as the Tuxedo service to be invoked.
<span> EABMQSend </span> (send a message to BMQ);
<span> EABMQReceive </span> (receive a message from BMQ);
<span> EABMQReply </span> (reply to a message that was received previously).
<span> EABMQReqReply </span> (send a message and receive a synchronous reply);
Sending a message ( <span> EABMQSend </span> )
The Tuxedo service <span> EABMQSend </span> allows a message to be sent to BMQ.
The Tuxedo client invokes this service by transferring the input FML32 buffer containing the operation named ( <span> ID_SRVC </span> ), data fields and any other fields, such as the message TID, error codes, and so on.
The specified name must match the name of the service configured in the <span> repository </span> of the BMQ library.
If the <span> DATA </span> field is empty, <span> LEN_DATA </span> must be set to “0”.
<span> IB_DATA </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_ID_REQ </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_RPLY_ADDR </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_MAJ_CODE </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_MIN_CODE </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP1 </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP2 </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
Receiving a message ( <span> EABMQReceive </span> )
EABMQReceive is invoked directly by the Tuxedo client with a <span> tpcall </span> , Consequently, the service immediately returns the FML32 buffer containing the received message to the client.
EABMQReceive is performed automatically at the Tuxedo <span> startup </span> (if the parameter ‘ <span> -L </span> ’ has been specified in the CLOPT of the <span> ubbconfig </span> for the service itself. See
In this case, the service listens on the BMQ receiving queue (until it receives a 999-type “ <span> shutdown </span> ” message):
If the <span> DATA </span> field is empty, <span> LEN_DATA </span> must be “0”.
<span> IB_MAJ_CODE </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_MIN_CODE </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP1 </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP2 </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
Reply to a request message ( <span> EABMQReply </span> )
To reply to a request message (previously read with <span> EABMQReceive </span> ), you need to use the <span> EABMQReply </span> service, transferring the TID ( <span> ID_REQ </span> field) of the received message.
represents the message TID on BMQ. It must be the one that was read in the previous <span> EABMQReceive. </span>
Sending a request and receiving a reply in synchronous mode ( <span> EABMQReqReply </span> )
Executable used to send a “SHUTDOWN” message (999 type msg) on BMQ for the <span> EABMQReceive </span>
Libraries for the <span> trace </span>
The <span> libBmqoo </span> library provides a high-level object interface for the use of the BEA MessageQ (BMQ), which means the user no longer has to know the details of the BMQ API.
To carry out this function, EABMQ uses the <span> TimBmqLib </span> library (vers.
As well as the normal send ( <span> send </span> ) and receive ( <span> receive </span> ) message functions, there are two additional high-level functions:
<span> RequestReply </span> :
<span> Reply </span> :
Oracle DBMS, v. 8.1.6. (Optional, cfr. <a> ).
<span> CSvcMgr </span> is implemented as a singleton, therefore there can be only one instance within a process.
<span> ICfgType </span> <span> : </span>
<span> pcLoadString </span> <span> : </span> depending on the type of configuration, this contains the path name of the configuration file or the database connection string <span> </span> (in format ‘ <span> utente/password@SID </span> ’);
Following the first initialisation, reference to the instance of <span> CSvcMgr </span> can be obtained using the method:
The <span> createMsg </span> function lets you create a draft of a message to be sent, with all fields completed. All fields of the BMQ message, including the TIM header, are set in a manner that is transparent to the user, who only has to set the body.

IBSBMQ <span> . </span>
The group of <span> IBSBMQ </span> InfoBus servers provides an interface between IBS services (the core of InfoBus) and the BMQ (Bea MessageQ)world, used as a middleware platform by most TIM systems.
The IBSBMQ module is inserted in the architecture shown in Figure <a> . In particular, it uses the functions of the eLink/BMQ <span> EABMQ </span> adapter (see <a> ) and, indirectly, the functions of the libBmqoo library (see <a> ).
<span> IBSBMQReceive </span> :
<span> IBSBMQReceive </span> service; collects all messages received by the EABMQ receiver.
<span> IBSBMQServices </span> :
<span> IBSBMQSend </span> , <span> IBSQBMRequestReply </span> and <span> IBSQBMReply </span> services; invoked by the IBS, these carry out the function of asynchronous and synchronous dialog towards the systems of the BMQ world; the latter is invoked by <span> IBSBMQReceive </span> to send a reply to a BMQ client in the case of synchronous.
<span> IBSGetBMQParam </span> :
IBSBMQ also needs the <span> EABMQ </span> adapter. For installation see the <a> .
the event identifier, if using a Publishing & Subscribe mechanism, setting the <span> ID_EVENT </span> field <span> . </span>
<span> IBSBMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> and <span> IBSBMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> <span> </span> have the same meaning and value described for the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section;
<span> ORACLE_SRVC </span> <span> </span> Oracle SID or Oracle service of SQL-Net;
<span> USER </span> the user of the Database containing the InfoBus configurations;
Prior configuration of the <span> EABMQ </span> adapter and the <span> libBmqoo </span> library service is required for the configuration of IBSBMQ.
For IBSBMQ to function correctly, the following parameters must be set in the CLOPT configuration of the <span> EABMQReceive </span> server:
<span> -L </span> :
<span> -R </span> :
<span> -T </span> :
For each message, a tpcall of the Tuxedo service specified with S is performed: it is set to <span> C </span> ;
<span> -S </span> :
Tuxedo service to be invoked for each received message; set to <span> IBSBMQReceive. </span>
<span> -S </span> <span> IBSBMQReceive </span> <span> -R ALL_TYPES </span> "
<span> IBSBMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> gives the name of the group relating to services published by <span> IBSBMQServices </span> ;
<span> IBSBMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> gives <span> </span> the name of the group relating to services published by <span> IBSBMQReceive; </span>
<span> ASYNC_SRVC1 </span> and <span> ASYNC_SRVC1 </span> are the aliases of the <span> </span> IBSBMQSend services used by InfoBus to invoke the service itself; these aliases must correspond with service identifiers (ID_SRVC) in InfoBus configurations;

Similarly, it is possible to request invoice data with the <span> DATIFATTURE </span> service.
The BIP system sends a recharge migration request for prepaid to the OPSC system using the <span> RICARACI </span> service. The transaction is synchronous / synchronous.
Then, BIP sends a notification of the service migration using <span> COMMITSIARC </span> in asynchronous mode to the OPSC.
Finally, the prepaid account is reactivated with the <span> RIATTIVOL </span> service.
The BIP system uses the <span> VERIFICA_CC </span> service to send a request to verify the credit card debit to a Tuxedo queue, where the IGFS system extracts the information. Communication between the two systems takes place in call-back mode for BIP and asynchronous mode ( <span> GetRequest </span> ) for IGFS.
SP uses the <span> SPRICARICA </span> service to send a recharge request to BIP, providing the code and the amount.
Before sending the response, BIP sends a request to InfoBus to encrypt the keys by calling the <span> CRYPTDES </span> service.
After the message has been encrypted, BIP sends the recharge request to OPSC using the <span> RICBANCOTIM </span> service.
Once the operation has been performed successfully, BIP sends a notification to OPSC by invoking the <span> COMMITBCOTIM </span> service.
The OPSC system sends an outcome also to SID using the <span> ESIRICBCOTIM </span> service.
The SID system invokes the <span> SIDCCRM </span> service and sends a message to an InfoBus BMQ queue destined for the interface. Depending on the value in an app_dep_1 field in the BMQ message header, and using a routing criterion, it is put in a Tuxedo queue.
To extract the CCRM message using SIEBEL, it will call the <span> SIDCCRMGSM1, SIDCCRMGSM2, SIDCCRMGSM3, SIDCCRMGSM4 </span> and <span> SIDCCRMTACS </span> services.
The outcomes of activities run on ASP and ASAP systems during normal Customer Care activities are sent from them to CCRM using the <span> ASPCCRM </span> and <span> ASAPCCRM </span> services.
The BIP system uses the <span> CONFDOMI </span> service to send an account domicile confirmation request to the DPPSI system.
Moreover, the BIP system can invoke the <span> VERUTEDOMI </span> service in order to verify the domicile of the account.
The SID system uses the <span> ATTIVAZIONE </span> service to send a request to BIP to activate an EASYBUY account.
BIP uses the <span> NOTIATTI </span> service to send a notification of activation of the EASYBUYaccount to SID;
The BIP system can also request verification of the EASYBUY account activation from the DPPS-I system using the <span> VERUTEEBUY </span> service. Both manage the service in synchronous/synchronous mode.
The CRM-B uses its own services to transfer to SIMBA notifications of creation of a Customer Portfolio ( <span> NOTIACCORDO </span> ), Framework Agreement ( <span> NOTIPORTAFOG </span> ) and Order ( <span> NOTIORDINE </span> ).
The SIMBA system then confirms ( <span> CONFACQPOROR </span> ) acquisition of a notification transmitted byCRM-B. The dialog mode is asynchronous/asynchronous.

• <span> </span> Selection of two appliances for the subsequent phase (Testing)
The data is loaded by the <span> Acquisition </span> service in a data area called the “Parking Area” in a rapid and draft manner, possibly only applying in this phase the first <span> pre-filtering </span> rules, thus avoiding the loading of variations in personnel details of no interest to the Ministry.
Subsequently the <span> Validation </span> service will deal with:

<span> Hashing </span> ;
<span> Signing </span> ;
<span> Cyphering </span> :

it is actually for this purpose that the “ <span> Wind Discarded Area </span> ” was created.

For this purpose the Operation will have a first worklist available ( <span> Wind Worklist </span> ) with the signaling of the Wind discards.
There arises the need to have another discard area “ <span> MIN Discarded Area </span> ” different from the one illustrated previously.

When the <span> OTA </span> platform is <span> out of service </span> , the files deposited by the Transfer Process in the directory are deleted and are not inserted in the Smart Roaming DB.
The information, contained in a <span> SR_Config.txt </span> configuration file, relate to:
If the OTA Agent (see Paragraph <a> ) does not respond to a request from the SR Core (e.g. the OTA platform is not active), it deletes the record (MSISDN) from the DB whose request was not answered.
The NEXT thread manages all the MSISDN for which it is necessary to proceed with the invocation of the OTA services (record for which the status of the configuration is “ <span> PRE_LOAD </span> ” or “ <span> OTA_OK </span> ”).
The service is invoked for each record extracted and relates to the next step in which configuration takes place and the “ <span> OTA_SUBMIT </span> ” <span> or </span> “ <span> OTA_KO </span> ” <span> status is set, if the OTA gives an error message. </span>
The END thread manages all the MSISDN for which the reconfiguration flow has successfully terminated (records with “ <span> OK </span> ” configuration status).
Last Location Update on “Preferred” Network <a> PREFERRED_AFTER_OK
Last Location Update on “Not Preferred” network <a> NOT_PREFERRED <a> set the status to “PRE_LOAD” and increase the NUM_ATTEMPT
The RETRY thread manages all the MSISDN with a negative result on an OTA command (record with O <span> TA_KO </span> ” <span> configuration status </span> ) <span> . </span>
Last Location Update on “Preferred” network <a> PREFERRED_AFTER_OTAKO <a> no action towards OTA
Last Location Update on “Not Preferred” network <a> resubmission of the OTA command and increase in NUM_ATTEMPT
it loads in the memory the information relating to the service configuration (e.g. configuration file <span> SR_Config.txt </span> , table of MSISDN to process and system parameters...)
The OTA Result Client, based on the results from the OTA platform, via the RMI RM Stub, invokes the methods displayed by the “ <span> SRResultManagerInterface </span> ” interface (see Appendix 5.4).
<span> OTA_OK </span> :
the OTA Result Client invokes the <span> sendOTAOK </span> method and sends it to the Result Manager which, in the process table advances the service status to the subsequent one and resets the number of retries on the OTA commands and the retry time.
the OTA Result Client invokes the send <span> OTAKO </span> method to the Result Manager which, in the process table, increases the number of OTA retries and resets the retry time.
The RMI SR server provides an interface towards the SR Core, containing all the remote methods that can be invoked. The SR Core based on the requests coming from the NEXT and RETRY threads described in paragraph <a> , via the RMI SR Stub invokes the remote methods displayed by the “SRAgentRMIInterface” interface (see Appendix <a> ).

The <span> Opportunity Assessment </span> phase essentially assesses the technical, organisational and financial aspects in general terms, relating to CUSTOMER requests, to check the use features that the parties are about to sustain.
The <span> Development & Proposal </span> phase responds to the need to fully define CUSTOMER requests and therefore set the project contents and limits, including the possible organisational impacts that the solution provision could cause.

<span> Step 4. </span> Translate the new data model via the command:
Answer <span> y </span> , otherwise the command is deleted.
<span> Step 5. </span> Apply the new data model via the command:
stop the service on SMPBIN via the command <span> smshalt </span>
cancel the file typeDB.100.38 in the directory <span> /usmpconfig/Platforms/SCP_1/config/typeDB </span> on SMPBIN
<span> If all the conditions are not satisfied, </span> the event is rejected and the SR system doesn’t perform any actions relating to the registered event.
If the ASC received for a running configuration is on a preferred operator the <span> id_policy_last as NULL </span> is updated and as a result managed by the SRCore module, as this is the only way it will be recognised as preferred by this module.
For the ASC relating to operators in countries with non configured policies, it is necessary to introduce a support policy with <span> id_policy = 1 </span> on the DB, which is of fundamental importance for the insert_configuration trigger.
The result of the invocation is not waited for, before setting the status on SUBMIT or KO, to maintain coherence with the result that the ResultManager (see paragraph <a> ) will update; this strategy is necessary since it could occur in the following situation:
The methods <span> sendOTAOK and </span> <span> sendOTAKO </span> are exported towards the OTA server and the <span> refresh </span> method is exported towards the web interface <span> . </span>
The method <span> sendOTAOK </span> updates the configuration by setting id_configuration_result = OTA_OK and for the DownloadApplet service sets the flag applet_loaded = 1.
The method <span> sendOTAOK </span> updates the configuration by setting id_configuration_result = OTA_KO, num_retry = num_retry+1, retry_time= sysdate+ t_retry, which is the time interval between two retries defined by the system_parameter.
The <span> refresh </span> method performs a select on the system_parameter and develops the variables sys_max_retry, max_attempt, t_retry.
This constantly memorises the parameters contained in the file and provides all the functionalities ( <span> getProp(), getIntProp() </span> ) to read such parameters.
The information, contained in the configuration file <span> sragent.properties (see paragraph </span> <span> ) </span> , relates to:
( <span> IP remote server, negotiation port to exchange RMI messages </span> )
( <span> IP, user and password, communication port,…) </span>
( <span> PACKAGE_ID, APPLET_ID, INSTANCE_ID,… </span> )
The SR Core based on the requests coming from the NEXT and RETRY threads described in paragraph <a> , via the RMI SR Stub invokes the remote methods displayed by the “SRAgentRMIInterface” interface (see Appendix <a> ).
On start-up of the component, the <span> SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl </span> is launched; this provides all and implements all the remote invocation methods via RMI.
SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl instantiates in the memory the <span> PlatfomSession </span> object, which deals with creating a persistent connection with the OTA platform and performs authentication towards the internal modules of the OTA system:
On arrival of a request from the SmartRoaming system, the SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl module invokes the relative functionality via the <span> PlatformFacility </span> module.
The <span> PlatformFacility </span> is the component that interacts directly with the platform and sends the requests directly via the API OTA.
The asynchronous method with which the command is forwarded to the OTA platform occurs via the <span> TELECOMApplication.post () </span> functionality of the API OTA.
The Listener is implemented by the <span> SRListener </span> module and is the object created by the <span> PlatfomSession </span> on first connection to the OTA platform for the asynchronous acquisition of results relating to the sending of the OTA commands.
The SRListener implements the OTA <span> InvocationEventListener </span> component, which provides the customisable <span> notify() </span> method invoked each time a specific event is verified.
The result coming from the platform is composed of the object <span> ServiceResult </span> (API OTA) created by the platform after managing the previously forwarded request.
The listener therefore deals with distinguishing the result of the request (FAILED, DELIVERED, etc.) and sends the result of this request sendOTAOK or sendOTAKO to the SmartRoaming platform via the <span> OTA Result Client </span> component.
The OTA Result Client is the component activated by the Listener OTA on receipt of the result on individual OTA commands and consists of the <span> SRResultClient </span> module.
