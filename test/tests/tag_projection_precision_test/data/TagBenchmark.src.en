<em>The main objective of Memopal is to guarantee a high level of security for its users&apos; data.
<br/>The data structure containing links between the files and the owner is also encrypted.
<br/>Memopal works well with firewalls because it uses the same protocol as the user to view websites (HTTP and HTTPS protocol) and is thus compatible with firewalls and proxies.

The main trends <br/></cf>
<cf><cf>Mainstream Business:
consolidation taking place with the big players entering with M&A (IBM, Microsoft, Symantec and EMC) </cf><cf><br/>
<cf>Low entry barriers:
<cf>Differentiation on the scale of data managed:
between Free (little band or little time) and Premium (unlimited) </cf><cf><br/></cf>
<cf>To confirm this let&apos;s have a look at what&apos;s happening in the world.
<sr/>Spain:
we have already reached the magnitude of Atrapalo in the month of August <br/></cf>
<cf>The competition scenario:
<cf><cf>The company was established in Boston in 2005 and has  </cf><cf>80 employees </cf><cf><br/></cf>
<cf>Other than the founding partners, Carbonite was backed by Venture Capital:
<cf>In 2008, Carbonite achieved a third increase in capital with USD 20 million (overall the company acquired  </cf><cf>USD 47 million  </cf><cf>as funds) <br/>
<cf><cf>Mozy was launched in the United States (Utah) in  </cf><cf>2005 and in the first two years since start-up has earned just 2 million USD </cf><br/>
<cf>Mozy was purchased by EMC in 2007 for  </cf><cf>~ USD 76 million </cf><cf>.
<cf>Swapdrive was founded in  <cf>Washington in 1998 </cf> and has managed in just a few years to distribute its products with a network of over 60 partners (Iomega, Dell, Intuit, Best Buy and Symantec)  <cf>favouring the white label modality </cf><br/>
When the company was sold to Symantec it had over 13,000 new customers per day   <br/>
The company got around 2.65M in 2001 from venture capital and angels to which other rounds were added, with details of the valuation of resources acquired unknown <br/>
positioning <br/></cf>
<cf>Note:
the dimension represents offer competition (technical valuation, customer satisfaction) based on sector magazines <br/></cf>
<cf>SwapDrive is the online backup system  <cf>white label solution provided by the Norton 360 antivirus company </cf><br/>
In 2007 Swapdrive generated  <cf>USD 22 million revenue with a margin of around USD 13 Million </cf><br/>

selecting <i>Yes</i>, the point-to-point interface (ppp0, ppp1, ...) is automatically set as the default route without having to manually set a static route for this purpose.

Lastly, since more than one 3G modem can be connected to the router and the Zeroshell <i>Net Balancer</i> module is used, settings can be created to balance connections on several operators and with Failover.

One of the most dangerous navigation traps is called <i>Phishing</i>.
Simply use the two DNS, <i>208.67.222.222</i> and <i>208.67.220.220</i> to use OpenDNS to improve response time and fight Phishing without any other worries.
In addition to controlling content using the default categories, you can setup your own <i>blacklist</i> and <i>whitelist</i> to block or permit access to certain sites.
Remember that statistics must be activated on the dashboard following <a>OpenDNS</a> registration.
Another possibility, if you have a DNS server on your LAN, it to have the server work as a DNS cache set to use OpenDNS as <i>Forwarders</i> to resolve any non authoritative domain.
This way, when the client response is not in the LAN DNS cache, forwards the request to the OpenDNS server instead of <i>ROOT DNS</i>.
To set up the Zeroshell DNS server as described to use OpenDNS as forwarders, simply display the  [DNS][Forwarders] section and update services with IP 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 separated by a comma and specifying <i>ANY</i> as the domain.
To set it, simply select <i>OpenDNS</i> as the domain in the [DNS][Dynamic DNS] section (as illustrated above), enter your OpenDNS account username and password and activate the service.
This block should be set in the <i>FORWARD</i> chain to process router traffic.

<a> The main objective of Memopal is to guarantee a high level of security for its users' data.
<a> The data structure containing links between the files and the owner is also encrypted.
<a> Memopal works well with firewalls because it uses the same protocol as the user to view websites (HTTP and HTTPS protocol) and is thus compatible with firewalls and proxies.
These services concern the activation ( <span> BANKATTI) </span> and deactivation <span> </span> ( <span> BANKDISA </span> ) of the Bankamatic-POS service.
<a> Access your files <a> Access your files </a>
<span> VERUTESYNC </span> is an alternative version of the <span> VERUTE </span> service, and can be invoked in synchronous / synchronous mode.
If the outcome of the <span> VERUTE </span> service is positive, the BIP system sends the recharge request to OPSC (via an asynchronous <span> RICARICA </span> service).
In turn, OPSC sends the recharge notification to BIP, via the asynchronous <span> NOTIRICA </span> service.
This generates different notification events, depending on whether the user has a TACS ( <span> EVNORI_T </span> ) or GSM ( <span> EVNORI_G </span> ) account.
InfoBus manages these events by forwarding an equal number of notifications, <span> NOTIRI_T </span> and <span> NOTIRI_G </span> , to the SID system.
The outcome of the recharge service is then sent to the SID system via the <span> ESIRICSI </span> service.

The corresponding services used to activate and deactivate domiciliation are <span> DOMIATTI </span> and <span> DOMIDISA. </span>
When InfoBus receives a reply from OPSC, it forwards this response to BIP and generates a <span> COMMIT </span> event towards the OPSC.
OPSC automatically disables domiciliation towards BIP using the <span> REVODOMI </span> service. The service is asynchronous without response.
The BIP system uses the <span> ANAPREP </span> service to check the existence of registration data for all recharge processes towards the OPSC system.
At this point BIP uses the <span> VERUTE </span> service (verify account), to check whether the user can recharge their card. The service is call-back/synchronous.

The following <span> use-case </span> UML diagram shows the functions (implemented using the appropriate services) that the InfoBus platform makes available to the VAS916 system.
The SRTC system, through BIP, sends a request to OPSC to enable ( <span> ROAMABIL </span> ), or disable roaming <span> </span> ( <span> ROAMDISA </span> ). It does this by calling the relevant service.
The OPSC then notifies ( <span> NOTIROAM </span> ) execution of the service that was requested by BIP; this generates a <span> EVNOABRO </span> or <span> EVNODIRO </span> notification event, which InfoBus manages by forwarding an equal number of notifications to the NAT system, <span> NOTIABRO </span> or <span> NOTIDIRO </span> .

The <span> tpsvrinit </span> function is also implemented. It is called when the server is initialised.
Request Identifier ( <span> ID_REQ </span> )
<span> J2EE </span>  Standard specifications for application servers.
<span> InfoBus </span>  TIM middleware system.
<span> InfoBus::InfoBus </span>  Enterprise Java Bean (EJB) that offers InfoBus services to J2EE applications.
<span> J2EE System </span>  Generic J2EE system to interface with InfoBus.
<span> J2EE System::InBound </span>  J2EE System can be invoked by other systems connected to InfoBus.
The home interface must have the <span> create() </span> method, which restores a remote interface.
The home interface can raise <span> RemoteException </span> and <span> CreateException </span> exceptions.
<span> throws RemoteException; </span>   Where <span> someMethodName </span> is any valid Java identifier.
The <span> IBInfo </span> parameter contains data for the application.
<span> throws RemoteException </span>   Typically, this method must be provided if the bean is used in an Asynchronous/Callback communication paradigm, but other scenarios should not be excluded.
The <span> IBError </span> parameter provides the reason for the error.
JNDI Initial Context factory (for example <span> weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory </span> for BEA WLS).
URL for connection to the server (for example <span> t3://machinename:port </span> for BEA WLS)
Obtains the response to a previous <span> request() </span> .
For <span> msg, </span> only the <span> idSystem </span> , <span> idSrvc </span> and <span> idRequest </span> fields are significant.
The message sent is a reply to a message extracted with <span> getRequest() </span> .
It can be used to obtain the responses to requests made with <span> request() </span> regardless of the TID.
For <span> msg, </span> only the <span> idSystem </span> and <span> idSrvc </span> fields are significant.
In the event of error, all the previous methods raise an <span> IBError </span> exception that describes the reason for the error.
The values in <span> bold </span> should be changed as needed.
For connections to InfoBus it is necessary to deploy the <span> InfobusEJBWTC.jar </span> file, which contains the EJBs provided by InfoBus, on the application server.
InfobusEJBWTC.jar already contains the deployment descriptors <span> ejb-jar.xml </span> and <span> weblogic-ejb-jar.xml </span> .
In particular, the JNDI names <span> ToInfoBUS </span> and <span> FromInfoBUS </span> are defined in weblogic-ejb-jar.xml.
the <span> InfobusEjbClient.jar </span> and <span> InfobusFMLdefs.jar </span> files are inserted in the JVM classpath.
The <span> InfobusEJBWTC.jar </span> and <span> InfobusFMLdefs.jar </span> files are inserted in the JVM classpath.
The relevant Java classes for InfoBus EJB clients are contained in the <span> InfobusEjbClient.jar </span> file:
<span> InfobusEjbClient.jar </span> also contains the stubs needed to use the EJBs.
InfoBUS distributes EJBs with deployment descriptors ( <span> ejb-jar.xml </span> and <span> weblogic-ejb-jar.xml </span> ).
<span> ToInfoBUS </span> for the home interface of remote clients
<span> ToInfoBUSLocal </span> for the local home interface of local clients
Import the packages <span> infobus.* </span> , <span> infobus.ejb.* </span> e <span> infobus.util.* </span>
perform a lookup on JNDI with the name <span> ToInfoBUS </span>
The log messages are produced by the subsystems <span> ToInfobusEJB </span> (for data inbound to InfoBus, outbound from J2EE System) and <span> FromInfobusEJB </span> (for data outbound from InfoBus, inbound to J2EE System).
The trace levels used by the monitoring log messages (that is, class ‘ <span> MON </span> ’), will use a range of values separate from those of all other classes.
Tracing log messages of various levels and class ‘ <span> MON </span> ’ is guided by the environment variable <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> .
if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has not been defined, no ‘ <span> MON </span> ’ class message will be issued.
The environment variable <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> is added to the one that already exists ( <span> TRCAPP_LOGINIT </span> ), which continues to guide the tracing of the log messages of all other classes.
<span> <modulo> </span> is the InfoBUS module running the log
<span> yyyymmgg </span> is the log date (year, month and day)
<span> nnnnnn </span> is a sequential counter, which goes up each time the file reaches the maximum size and a new file is created.
if the environment variable <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> is not set, the log files will not be split by size and their name will not include the sequential number. Instead, they will have the following format:
If the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable is defined (and therefore the log messages are activated, see paragraph 5), regardless of how the <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> variable is set, the changing of the log file by a process is indicated with a monitoring message at INFO level, according to the following format:
log time and date expressed as <span> yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.mmmmmm </span> (year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds)
the switch message is not run if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has not been defined.
if the <span> TRCMON_LOGINIT </span> variable has been defined, the switch message is run, regardless of the <span> TRCAPP_LOGSIZE </span> variable.

<span> Methodological approach </span> The methodological approach proposed by HP to deal with the implementation of the proposed project is based on a simple series of points and rules to be followed; we explain the most important below:
<span> Define realistic objectives, balancing time, costs and functionality </span> The functional and temporal objectives must be tuned to define and design a realistic plan to activate the systems.
<span> Use of its structure </span> Each workgroup must be capable of easily using all the structures and know-how of its company, to easily and rapidly find the necessary information and assistance, when requested.
The folders called “Budget approved <aaaa>” and included in the Corporate (ICT Trenitalia) folders, will be subject to a standard SAP EP approval workflow, for the first step of which the approver is the manager of ICT System Management.

<a> <a> <span> 1) Who are the Migration Team? </span> <a> .
Ensure you <span> ALWAYS </span> access your PC using the FIATAUTO domain.
<a> <a> <a> 2) I would like more information.
We therefore propose the Lan EHC to be connected on the ASF firewalls ( <span> RMVSK01F, RMVSK02F). </span>

Who should I contact? <a> <a> .
<a> <a> <a> <a> <span> Info on Preparation Procedure </span> <a> .
<a> <a> <span> 3) What happens when I perform the preparation procedure (click on “Check”)? </span> <a> .
If there is an error, press the " <span> Cancel </span> " button and notify the help desk of the problem, using the numbers found at the end of this document.
Type your new password twice and press the “ <span> OK </span> ” button.
<a> <a> <span> 5) What happens if I cannot click before March 31st? </span> <a> .
<a> <a> <a> <a> <span> Problems during Preparation Procedure </span> <a> .
In this case, <span> tasks are performed using a script provided by HP. </span>
By selecting “ <span> Yes </span> ” the .NET Framework 1.1 will automatically install on your PC (if previous versions of .NET Framework are present they will not be altered).
<a> <a> <a> 7) When I try to access the page http://www.fiatauto.com/migrazione I cannot connect or I get an error.
What should I do? <a> <a> .
You can <span> manually intervene </span> on these PCs to reconfigure the network parameters:
<a> <a> <a> 8) Click on “Check” doesn't work.
The activities scheduled for the <span> ANALYSIS </span> phase include:
<span> <span> <span> 9) Having started the procedure I get an error message relating to network problems (for example, the message contains a “network error …”) </span> <span> 3 </span> </span> </span>
It is not possible on these workstations to run scripts that were created for migration and it is therefore necessary to <span> manually intervene </span> to:
<span> PC in domain with administrative use common to all PCs </span> (the classic case of the Administrator or equivalent of the domain which is inserted in the Domain Admins group, a group which in turn is inserted in the local administrators group present on all PCs);
<span> PC in domain or workgroup with local administrative use </span> (this can be virtually common to all PCs if the local administrator user has the same password for all PCs).
In this case, <span> the activities can be manually performed </span> , exactly as for PCs with Windows NT4 <span> or using a script provided by HP </span> .
Once your PC has re-started, access it using your user, new password and <span> FIATAUTO </span> domain.
From now on you can no longer use your old user name on the old domain (ITALY1, ITALY2, local user), but <span> ALWAYS </span> use the new user with the new password.
The “ <span> Messages Viewer </span> ” provides you with the necessary instructions to continue with the procedure.
At this point you have the possibility to press “ <span> Next </span> ” to continue with the procedure or press “Cancel” to postpone the operation.
By pressing “ <span> Next </span> ” the following screen appears:
On doing so, press the “ <span> Start </span> ” button.
Reinsert your password and press “ <span> Start </span> ”.
The next window will allow you to set your new password on the <span> FIATAUTO </span> domain.

<a> <a> 1) Who are the Migration Team? </a> </a> <a>
<span> If you require further information relating to migration procedures, you can contact us at <a> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <a>  . </span>
<span> 3) What happens when I perform the preparation procedure (click on </span> “ <span> Check </span> ” <span> )? </span>
<span> From Outlook select Contacts > with the right button select Proprieties > </span> “ <span> Outlook Address Book </span> ” <span> > activate the flag </span> “ <span> Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book </span> ” <span> . </span>
<span> The preparation procedure to migration, which is activated by clicking on the “Check” button on the web page, </span> <a> enables the technical migration of the new services.
Furthermore, it can prevent potential inconveniences that could arise after the e-mail service migration. <a>
<a> 4) What does NOT happen when I perform the preparation procedure?
<a> 5) What happens if I cannot click before March 31st?
<a> Starting from the <a> 31st March <a> the e-mail service will be migrated.
If this does not work, ask the user on what share server they operate and inform <a> of this information, asking them to check if these servers are already in trust with FIATAUTO
If you do not perform the procedure, on first access to Outlook after service migration, you could encounter some problems such as: <a>
<span> No Outlook connection to mail server </span> <span> </span>
A <span> REGEDIT /S </span> command is launched to import some registry keys which enable the component installation path to be redirected.
“ <span> Attention! </span>
At the same time, an <span> ok.mig </span> file is created in the position <span> %USERPROFILE% </span> on the user PC.
<span> ProfileImagePath </span> (new user on FIATAUTO) <span> = %USERPROFILE% </span> (old user profile path)
To avoid this type of problem during the migration procedure, if intercepted, the installation of the SystemIpdate component in the PC redirects the installation path to the server <a> where the file SystemUpdate.msi is found.
<a> 6) How do I know if the procedure was successful?
Notify <a> of the manual intervention to enable complete registration of the operation.
<a> 7) When I try to access the page </a> <a> <a> http://www.fiatauto.com/migrazione </a> <a> </a> </a> <a> I cannot connect or get an error.
<span> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DisableDynamicUpdate=0 </span>   <span> ( </span> if not already updated, the dns dynamic update is enabled)
<a> <a> 9) Having started the procedure I get an error message relating to network problems (for example, the message contains a “network error …”) </a> </a> <span> </span>
<a> The preparation procedure is non invasive and will not modify any settings on your computer.
If you feel you need technical support, you can contact us on 119970 (199 619970 external). <a>
<a> The preparation procedure is non invasive and will not modify any settings on your computer.
<a> <a> 12) Selecting from the Address Book I can no longer see my “Personal contacts” </a> </a> <span> </span> .
In the first case notify <a> of the problem and wait for confirmation that the problem has been resolved. Then ask the user to restart the procedure.
In the second case, remind the user to read the user’s manual available on <a> and ask them to restart the procedure.
<a> Following the preparation for migration, which is activated by clicking on the “Check” button of the web page, the necessary technical checks will be activated.
Continue to access and use your mail as before. <a>
<a> 14) Following e-mail migration, will all the new services be operational?
<a> No, some functionalities will be available only after workstation migration, which will follow that of e-mail.
This operation is carried out by reading the attribute <span> mDBOverQuotaLimit </span> .
<span> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\SyncDomainWithMembership=1 </span>  (enable use of the domain extension as a dns extension)
When you have migrated, you will receive notification of same and the access methods to the new services. <a> <a>
<a> 15) What should I do to migrate my e-mail?
<a> Nothing.
<a> 19) When will my mailbox become at least 50 MB?
Following migration, if the user complains that on each logon a setup starts that regularly fails, it is enough to tell the user (or personally intervene) to modify the installation path <a> and click OK.
Your collaboration is requested only to activate the preparation procedure, following which the necessary technical checks will activate. <a>
<a> 16) Following e-mail migration, will my GAL (Address Book) data be modified?
<a> No.
Migration will not modify any local or PC data or data on the Global Access List. <a>
<a> 17) Will my e-mail authentication method change?
<a> </a> <a> </a> <a> </a> <a> </a> <span> 19) When will my mailbox become at least 50 MB?
<a> This new functionality will be available only after workstation migration, which will follow that of e-mail.
<a> 20) How can I access my post via web with the new Outlook Web Access?
The post-processing script is found in the folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\weblogging on the ITTRN1S3MIGR02 server and called XMLAnalyzer.exe   <span> By connecting to the aforementioned site (accessible to everyone) it is possible to support the users who call with procedure execution problems. </span>
<a> 21) What e-mail boxes will be migrated?
The <span> MBX_Logging </span> folder deals with the logs of users who "click".
What should I do? <a> <a> <a> .
<a> Perform the procedure.
<username>_<computername>_<data>_<ora>.xml
<a> where you can select by day the workstations to migrate.
<span> If </span> <span> </span> <a> your Outlook is configured with a default profile this profile will not be inconvenienced after migration.
The search is carried out on the entire <span> fiatauto.adfa.local </span> field.
If you have a default profile which is not configured among your profiles and you don't know how to configure it, contact us at <a> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <a> . <a>
<span> In this case it is important that you notify us of your configuration at </span> <a> <a> <span> Migrazione.PostaFA@fiat.com <span> </span> </span> <span> to avoid any problems with the service after migration. </span>
On termination of the copy, the <span> DetectFramework.vbs </span> script is run which has the task of checking the presence of .NET Framework 1.1 on the WKS to migrate.
The procedure writes each executable operation on a log file which is locally created on the user's PC and on its completion it is placed on share <a> where it is processed by the post-processing script.
<a> POP3/IMAP4 Server:
<ERR>User doesn't have admin permission</ERR>
mail.fiatauto.com <a>
Also in this case, as with the file share, collect info on the application in question and send it to <a>
<a> SMTP Server:
The <span> WKS_Migration </span> folder is where the log files relating to users who want to carry out a workstation move are copied.
The <span> WKS_Completed </span> folder is where log files relating to users who successfully migrated their workstations are moved.
If you wish to block the migration procedure for a user, you must at least know his or her USERID, find it in the <span> WKS_Migration folder on one of the three OWA01, 02, 03 servers </span> (<userID>_<computerName>.xml format) and cancel this file.
The file <span> download.bat </span> is run and copies the entire <span> wks </span> folder on the client of the PC in the position:
If you wish to block the migration procedure for a user, you must at least know his or her USERID, find it in the {\b WKS_Migration folder on one of the three OWA01, 02, 03 servers } (<userID>_<computerName>.xml format) and cancel this file.
<ERR>User doesn't have admin permission</ERR> 
<log>Successful user authentication:
WinNT://DOMAINNAME/USERNAME,user</log>
WinNT://DOMAINNAME/USERNAME,user</log>
LDAP://fiatauto.adfa.local/....</log>
NOT JOINED TO ANY DOMAIN</log>
<log>--------------------------</log>
In case of failure, it is necessary to manually intervene by logging on to the workstation using the user credentials on the old domain and insert the new user (FIATAUTO\<userID>) on the local admins.
You must remove the file <userID>_<workstationName>.xml from the folder WKS_Migration from one of the servers OWA01, 02, 03. A problem of this type could be when the user calls to complain that on each logon a pop-up appears that says:

The fundamental method for the <span> planning of the DCN </span> network used by HP is based on the following phases:
for example, the WEB SERVER category corresponds to the set of assets belonging to the {\i <Server> } , while Browser corresponds to the set of assets belonging to {\i <Client>. }
It is like a type of <span> Risk Based </span> approach, where the standard directs logical, physical and procedural controls used to process any detected vulnerability/risks and therefore covers the company security strategies and policies.

Simply use the two DNS, <span> 208.67.222.222 </span> and <span> 208.67.220.220 </span> to use OpenDNS to improve response time and fight Phishing without any other worries.
<a> <span> Dmailer distributes its local backup product on 30M USB pens per year. </span>
Remember that statistics must be activated on the dashboard following <span> OpenDNS </span> registration.
Another possibility, if you have a DNS server on your LAN, it to have the server work as a DNS cache set to use OpenDNS as <span> Forwarders </span> to resolve any non authoritative domain.
This way, when the client response is not in the LAN DNS cache, forwards the request to the OpenDNS server instead of <span> ROOT DNS </span> .
To set up the Zeroshell DNS server as described to use OpenDNS as forwarders, simply display the [DNS][Forwarders] section and update services with IP 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 separated by a comma and specifying <span> ANY </span> as the domain.
To set it, simply select <span> OpenDNS </span> as the domain in the [DNS][Dynamic DNS] section (as illustrated above), enter your OpenDNS account username and password and activate the service.
This block should be set in the <span> FORWARD </span> chain to process router traffic.

<span> E </span> Link <span> A </span> dapter for <span> BMQ </span> .
Tuxedo Service or, more simply, <span> Service </span>
BMQ Service or, more simply, <span> Operation </span>
The operation that must be run by the invoked Tuxedo service (for example “ <span> RICARICA </span> ”, “ <span> VERIFICA_UTENZA </span> ”).
EABMQ uses the <span> libBmqo </span> object library to perform this function, which exports the BMQ functions as high level services and, in turn, uses the <span> TimBmqLib </span> (vers.
The behaviour of the adapter is guided by the parameters specified in the Tuxedo ( <span> ubbconfig </span> ) and library configuration files (or db).
The Tuxedo user can invoke a <span> send </span> service instead of a <span> receive </span> or <span> request-reply </span> , without having to worry about low-level programming or the functioning of the BMQ itself.
The adapter’s functioning is based on the ‘ <span> Service </span> ’ concept - just like the object library it uses - which is a series of activities that carry out a precise function (send, receive, reply...).
To avoid confusion, from now on ‘ <span> service </span> ’ means the Tuxedo service and ‘ <span> operation </span> ’ means the requested BMQ service.
The client invokes the Tuxedo service (in the previous example, <span> EABMQSend </span> ) published by the adapter server in the BBL, and transfers a FML31 buffer as a parameter containing, among other things, the name of the requested operation ( <span> RICARICA </span> ).
At this point, the EABMQ adapter can extract the information from its repository needed to carry out the operation using the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
The communication protocol between any Tuxedo client and the EABMQ adapter foresees the use of Tuxedo’s standard interface. Therefore, the services published by the adapter itself are invoked by the client with a <span> tpcall </span> (synchronous call) or a <span> tpacall </span> (asynchronous call).
“ <span> $HOME/infobus </span> ” (the structure of this directory is described later);
When the account has been created, log in to the system as “ <span> infobus </span> ” and, from the home directory, run the “ <span> EA_install </span> ” script provided with the installation package.
<span> FLDTBLDIR32 </span> = path for the FML32 file.
Must be set with the complete path of the FML32 files ( <span> /home/infobus/EABMQ/fml </span> ).
<span> FIELDTBLS32 </span> = the name of the FML32 file which will be used ( <span> EABMQ.fml32 </span> , I <span> nfobus.fml32 </span> ) by the adapter.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGDIR </span> = path for the trace of the adapter.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGINIT= </span> trace level of the adapter.
<span> TIMBMQ_LOGDIR </span> = path for the trace of the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
<span> TRCAPP_LOGDIR </span> ).
<span> TIMBMQ_LOGINIT= </span> trace level of the <span> libBmqoo </span> library.
In the directory containing the environment files (( <span> /home/infobus/EABMQ/env </span> ) there is a script ( <span> eabmq.env </span> ) that sets the aforementioned environment variables.
The <span> libBmqoo.sl </span> object library reads the services configured in a repository that can consist of an Oracle database or a file in XML format (in the latter case, the DTD will be provided by the InfoBus group).
BMQ queue name (the name of the queue or the destination (receipt) BMQ binomial (“ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
Alternative response queue (the name of the queue or the binomial “ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
Notification queue name (the name of the queue or the binomial “ <span> gruppo.coda </span> ”).
See the previous paragraph for BMQ library configuration. ( <a> ).
For configuration of a Tuxedo service with the <span> ubbconfig </span> file, see the documentation provided with the product.
As there are two Tuxedo servers relating to the adapter (one publishing the <span> EABMQSend </span> , <span> EABMQReply </span> , <span> EABMQReqReply </span> services, and the other publishing the <span> EABMQReceive </span> service) there should be at least two “ <span> entries </span> ” in the configuration file.
The services of the EABMQ adapter must be configured in the Tuxedo configuration file ( <span> ubbconfig </span> ).
In the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section of the Tuxedo configuration file, specify the groups to which the services belong.
<span> GROUP_No </span> is the numeric identifier assigned to that group.
In the “ <span> *SERVERS </span> ” section, specify the parameters relating to the services themselves, following this format:
<span> EABMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> and <span> EABMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> <span> </span> have the same meaning and value described for the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section;
<span> ID_SERVER </span> is the order number of the server within the group;
<span> X </span> specifies the configuration read type (‘1’ = from database, ‘2’ = from XML file);
<span> CONNECT_STR </span> is the database connection string or the path of the XML configuration file for the library;
<span> only for </span> <span> EABMQReceive </span> :
<span> CALL_TYPE </span> specifies the call type when invoking the Tuxedo service that will manage the received message.
Possible values are ‘ <span> C </span> ’, which indicates a <span> tpcall </span> and ‘ <span> Q </span> ’, which indicates a <span> tpenqueue </span> ;
<span> TUXEDO_SRVC </span> is the name of the Tuxedo service to invoke (see
<span> CALL_TYPE </span> );
<span> QUEUE_SPACE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> for /Q queues;
<span> READ_SRVC </span> is the name of the BMQ read service (this must match one of the services configured for the BMQ library);
<span> ERR_QUEUE </span> gives the name of the /Q error queue in which messages that have been read and not delivered to the management Tuxedo will be put (see
<span> TUXEDO_SRVC </span> );
<span> -L </span> is an optional parameter, without topic, which, if present, tells the EABMQReceive to run an infinite cycle of reads from the BMQ.
To configure /Q, a <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> must be defined, the name of which will correspond with the one defined for the “ <span> -Q </span> ” in the <span> CLOPT </span> of the <span> EABMQReceive </span> service.
This <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> will contain the queues used by the service, and the error queue used to manage messages not received by the management Tuxedo service, defined by the “ <span> -E </span> ” parameter, always present in the <span> CLOPT </span> of the same service.
This error queue must be created in the indicated <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> .
To declare the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> , you need to define the following in the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section of the Tuxedo configuration file.
<span> QUEUE_SPACE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE SPACE </span> containing the /Q queues to be used;
<span> PATH_QDEVICE </span> is the path of the <span> QUEUE DEVICE </span> ;
<span> DEVICE </span> is the name of the <span> QUEUE DEVICE </span> .
<span> SRVC_QUEUE </span> is the name of the queue, which must be the same as the Tuxedo service to be invoked.
<span> EABMQSend </span> (send a message to BMQ);
<span> EABMQReceive </span> (receive a message from BMQ);
<span> EABMQReply </span> (reply to a message that was received previously).
<span> EABMQReqReply </span> (send a message and receive a synchronous reply);
Sending a message ( <span> EABMQSend </span> )
The Tuxedo service <span> EABMQSend </span> allows a message to be sent to BMQ.
The Tuxedo client invokes this service by transferring the input FML32 buffer containing the operation named ( <span> ID_SRVC </span> ), data fields and any other fields, such as the message TID, error codes, and so on.
The specified name must match the name of the service configured in the <span> repository </span> of the BMQ library.
If the <span> DATA </span> field is empty, <span> LEN_DATA </span> must be set to “0”.
<span> IB_DATA </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_ID_REQ </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_RPLY_ADDR </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_MAJ_CODE </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_MIN_CODE </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP1 </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP2 </span> ( <span> optional </span> )
Receiving a message ( <span> EABMQReceive </span> )
EABMQReceive is invoked directly by the Tuxedo client with a <span> tpcall </span> , Consequently, the service immediately returns the FML32 buffer containing the received message to the client.
EABMQReceive is performed automatically at the Tuxedo <span> startup </span> (if the parameter ‘ <span> -L </span> ’ has been specified in the CLOPT of the <span> ubbconfig </span> for the service itself. See
In this case, the service listens on the BMQ receiving queue (until it receives a 999-type “ <span> shutdown </span> ” message):
If the <span> DATA </span> field is empty, <span> LEN_DATA </span> must be “0”.
<span> IB_MAJ_CODE </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_MIN_CODE </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP1 </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
<span> IB_APPDEP2 </span> ( <span> if set </span> )
Reply to a request message ( <span> EABMQReply </span> )
To reply to a request message (previously read with <span> EABMQReceive </span> ), you need to use the <span> EABMQReply </span> service, transferring the TID ( <span> ID_REQ </span> field) of the received message.
represents the message TID on BMQ. It must be the one that was read in the previous <span> EABMQReceive. </span>
Sending a request and receiving a reply in synchronous mode ( <span> EABMQReqReply </span> )
Executable used to send a “SHUTDOWN” message (999 type msg) on BMQ for the <span> EABMQReceive </span>
Libraries for the <span> trace </span>
The <span> libBmqoo </span> library provides a high-level object interface for the use of the BEA MessageQ (BMQ), which means the user no longer has to know the details of the BMQ API.
To carry out this function, EABMQ uses the <span> TimBmqLib </span> library (vers.
As well as the normal send ( <span> send </span> ) and receive ( <span> receive </span> ) message functions, there are two additional high-level functions:
<span> RequestReply </span> :
<span> Reply </span> :

<span> IBSBMQ </span> <span> Release 2.0.0 </span>
The group of <span> IBSBMQ </span> InfoBus servers provides an interface between IBS services (the core of InfoBus) and the BMQ (Bea MessageQ)world, used as a middleware platform by most TIM systems.
The IBSBMQ module is inserted in the architecture shown in Figure <a> . In particular, it uses the functions of the eLink/BMQ <span> EABMQ </span> adapter (see <a> ) and, indirectly, the functions of the libBmqoo library (see <a> ).
<span> IBSBMQReceive </span> :
<span> IBSBMQReceive </span> service; collects all messages received by the EABMQ receiver.
<span> IBSBMQServices </span> :
<span> IBSBMQSend </span> , <span> IBSQBMRequestReply </span> and <span> IBSQBMReply </span> services; invoked by the IBS, these carry out the function of asynchronous and synchronous dialog towards the systems of the BMQ world; the latter is invoked by <span> IBSBMQReceive </span> to send a reply to a BMQ client in the case of synchronous.
<span> IBSGetBMQParam </span> :
IBSBMQ also needs the <span> EABMQ </span> adapter. For installation see the <a> .
<span> IBSBMQSERVICES_GROUP </span> and <span> IBSBMQRECEIVE_GROUP </span> <span> </span> have the same meaning and value described for the “ <span> *GROUPS </span> ” section;
<span> ORACLE_SRVC </span> <span> </span> Oracle SID or Oracle service of SQL-Net;
Prior configuration of the <span> EABMQ </span> adapter and the <span> libBmqoo </span> library service is required for the configuration of IBSBMQ.
For IBSBMQ to function correctly, the following parameters must be set in the CLOPT configuration of the <span> EABMQReceive </span> server:
<span> -L </span> :
<span> -R </span> :
<span> -T </span> :
For each message, a tpcall of the Tuxedo service specified with S is performed: it is set to <span> C </span> ;

Finally, the prepaid account is reactivated with the <span> RIATTIVOL </span> service.
The BIP system uses the <span> VERIFICA_CC </span> service to send a request to verify the credit card debit to a Tuxedo queue, where the IGFS system extracts the information. Communication between the two systems takes place in call-back mode for BIP and asynchronous mode ( <span> GetRequest </span> ) for IGFS.
SP uses the <span> SPRICARICA </span> service to send a recharge request to BIP, providing the code and the amount.
Before sending the response, BIP sends a request to InfoBus to encrypt the keys by calling the <span> CRYPTDES </span> service.
After the message has been encrypted, BIP sends the recharge request to OPSC using the <span> RICBANCOTIM </span> service.
Once the operation has been performed successfully, BIP sends a notification to OPSC by invoking the <span> COMMITBCOTIM </span> service.
The OPSC system sends an outcome also to SID using the <span> ESIRICBCOTIM </span> service.
The SID system invokes the <span> SIDCCRM </span> service and sends a message to an InfoBus BMQ queue destined for the interface. Depending on the value in an app_dep_1 field in the BMQ message header, and using a routing criterion, it is put in a Tuxedo queue.
The outcomes of activities run on ASP and ASAP systems during normal Customer Care activities are sent from them to CCRM using the <span> ASPCCRM </span> and <span> ASAPCCRM </span> services.
The BIP system uses the <span> CONFDOMI </span> service to send an account domicile confirmation request to the DPPSI system.
Moreover, the BIP system can invoke the <span> VERUTEDOMI </span> service in order to verify the domicile of the account.
The SID system uses the <span> ATTIVAZIONE </span> service to send a request to BIP to activate an EASYBUY account.
BIP uses the <span> NOTIATTI </span> service to send a notification of activation of the EASYBUYaccount to SID;
The BIP system can also request verification of the EASYBUY account activation from the DPPS-I system using the <span> VERUTEEBUY </span> service. Both manage the service in synchronous/synchronous mode.
The CRM-B uses its own services to transfer to SIMBA notifications of creation of a Customer Portfolio ( <span> NOTIACCORDO </span> ), Framework Agreement ( <span> NOTIPORTAFOG </span> ) and Order ( <span> NOTIORDINE </span> ).
The SIMBA system then confirms ( <span> CONFACQPOROR </span> ) acquisition of a notification transmitted byCRM-B. The dialog mode is asynchronous/asynchronous.

The TSS2000 system can send a Change Apparatus request to the SIMBA, DPPSI and GSTM systems, using the services <span> SMBCHGAPP </span> , <span> CATSSDPPSI </span> , <span> CATSSGSTM </span> respectively.
the <span> READSMB </span> service is invoked for this purpose from SIMBA to InfoBus (to get the request later from a special InfoBus queue using a <span> getRequest </span> ).
The TSS2000 system then invokes the InfoBus <span> READTSS </span> service to get the response obtained by one of the aforementioned systems.

The information, contained in a <span> SR_Config.txt </span> configuration file, relate to:
If the OTA Agent (see Paragraph <a> ) does not respond to a request from the SR Core (e.g. the OTA platform is not active), it deletes the record (MSISDN) from the DB whose request was not answered.
The NEXT thread manages all the MSISDN for which it is necessary to proceed with the invocation of the OTA services (record for which the status of the configuration is “ <span> PRE_LOAD </span> ” or “ <span> OTA_OK </span> ”).
The END thread manages all the MSISDN for which the reconfiguration flow has successfully terminated (records with “ <span> OK </span> ” configuration status).

it loads in the memory the information relating to the service configuration (e.g. configuration file <span> SR_Config.txt </span> , table of MSISDN to process and system parameters...)
<span> OTA_OK </span> :
the OTA Result Client invokes the <span> sendOTAOK </span> method and sends it to the Result Manager which, in the process table advances the service status to the subsequent one and resets the number of retries on the OTA commands and the retry time.
the OTA Result Client invokes the send <span> OTAKO </span> method to the Result Manager which, in the process table, increases the number of OTA retries and resets the retry time.
The RMI SR server provides an interface towards the SR Core, containing all the remote methods that can be invoked. The SR Core based on the requests coming from the NEXT and RETRY threads described in paragraph <a> , via the RMI SR Stub invokes the remote methods displayed by the “SRAgentRMIInterface” interface (see Appendix <a> ).

<span> Step 5. </span> Apply the new data model via the command:
stop the service on SMPBIN via the command <span> smshalt </span>
cancel the file typeDB.100.38 in the directory <span> /usmpconfig/Platforms/SCP_1/config/typeDB </span> on SMPBIN
<span> If all the conditions are not satisfied, </span> the event is rejected and the SR system doesn’t perform any actions relating to the registered event.
If the ASC received for a running configuration is on a preferred operator the <span> id_policy_last as NULL </span> is updated and as a result managed by the SRCore module, as this is the only way it will be recognised as preferred by this module.
For the ASC relating to operators in countries with non configured policies, it is necessary to introduce a support policy with <span> id_policy = 1 </span> on the DB, which is of fundamental importance for the insert_configuration trigger.
The result of the invocation is not waited for, before setting the status on SUBMIT or KO, to maintain coherence with the result that the ResultManager (see paragraph <a> ) will update; this strategy is necessary since it could occur in the following situation:
The method <span> sendOTAOK </span> updates the configuration by setting id_configuration_result = OTA_OK and for the DownloadApplet service sets the flag applet_loaded = 1.
The method <span> sendOTAOK </span> updates the configuration by setting id_configuration_result = OTA_KO, num_retry = num_retry+1, retry_time= sysdate+ t_retry, which is the time interval between two retries defined by the system_parameter.
The <span> refresh </span> method performs a select on the system_parameter and develops the variables sys_max_retry, max_attempt, t_retry.
This constantly memorises the parameters contained in the file and provides all the functionalities ( <span> getProp(), getIntProp() </span> ) to read such parameters.
The information, contained in the configuration file <span> sragent.properties (see paragraph </span> <span> ) </span> , relates to:
( <span> IP remote server, negotiation port to exchange RMI messages </span> )
( <span> IP, user and password, communication port,…) </span>
( <span> PACKAGE_ID, APPLET_ID, INSTANCE_ID,… </span> )
The SR Core based on the requests coming from the NEXT and RETRY threads described in paragraph <a> , via the RMI SR Stub invokes the remote methods displayed by the “SRAgentRMIInterface” interface (see Appendix <a> ).
On start-up of the component, the <span> SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl </span> is launched; this provides all and implements all the remote invocation methods via RMI.
SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl instantiates in the memory the <span> PlatfomSession </span> object, which deals with creating a persistent connection with the OTA platform and performs authentication towards the internal modules of the OTA system:
On arrival of a request from the SmartRoaming system, the SRAgentRMIInterfaceImpl module invokes the relative functionality via the <span> PlatformFacility </span> module.
The <span> PlatformFacility </span> is the component that interacts directly with the platform and sends the requests directly via the API OTA.
The asynchronous method with which the command is forwarded to the OTA platform occurs via the <span> TELECOMApplication.post () </span> functionality of the API OTA.
The Listener is implemented by the <span> SRListener </span> module and is the object created by the <span> PlatfomSession </span> on first connection to the OTA platform for the asynchronous acquisition of results relating to the sending of the OTA commands.
The SRListener implements the OTA <span> InvocationEventListener </span> component, which provides the customisable <span> notify() </span> method invoked each time a specific event is verified.
The result coming from the platform is composed of the object <span> ServiceResult </span> (API OTA) created by the platform after managing the previously forwarded request.
The listener therefore deals with distinguishing the result of the request (FAILED, DELIVERED, etc.) and sends the result of this request sendOTAOK or sendOTAKO to the SmartRoaming platform via the <span> OTA Result Client </span> component.
The OTA Result Client is the component activated by the Listener OTA on receipt of the result on individual OTA commands and consists of the <span> SRResultClient </span> module.
