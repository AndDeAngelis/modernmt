	"full_description": "First, the provided source file is translated by using the mmt engine at provided api_port (default 8045). Then the translated-tag-score is calculated by comparing the tags in the source file and those in the translations. Three types of tags are taken into account: self-closing tags, comments, and standard ttag (with opening and closing markups). The translated-tag-score is a score measure to be maximized: 0.0 means 100% of errors, 1.0 means that all tags have been perfectly translated",
