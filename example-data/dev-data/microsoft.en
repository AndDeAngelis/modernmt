To see whether a control provides this custom properties dialog box, look for the Custom property in the Microsoft Access property sheet for this control.
The combo box control combines the features of a text box and a list box .
The GotFocus event differs from the Enter event in that the GotFocus event occurs every time a control receives the focus. For example, suppose the user clicks a check box on a form, then clicks a report, and finally clicks the check box on the form to bring it to the foreground. The GotFocus event occurs both times the check box receives the focus. In contrast, the Enter event occurs only the first time the user clicks the check box. The GotFocus event occurs after the Enter event.

The HyperlinkPart method returns information about data stored as a Hyperlink data type . String .
Each Control object is denoted by a particular intrinsic constant . For example, the intrinsic constant acTextBox is associated with a text box control, and acCommandButton is associated with a command button . The constants for the various Microsoft Access controls are set forth in the control's ControlType property.
msoAutomationSecurityForceDisable Access will not open any database that contains macros , Visual Basic for Applications code, update queries , data-definition queries , pass-through queries , or action queries . No security messages are shown to the user.
CurrentSectionTop Property

To create a command button or toggle button with a caption and a picture, you could include the desired caption as part of the bitmap and assign the bitmap to the Picture property of the control.

With the collections and properties of a Hierarchy object, you can do the following:
Schema.ini contains the specifics of a data source: how the data is formatted, and the names of columns that should be accessed.
You are attempting to create a replica using a partial replica as the source. Partial replicas cannot be replicated.
The database could not be made replicable because the specified object could not be replicated.
A problem has occurred accessing the TEMP directory on your computer.

Direction Property
A CONSTRAINT clause defining a single-field index. For more information on how to create this index, see CONSTRAINT Clause .
Column-level conflict resolution lets you merge two records and only report a conflict if simultaneous changes have been to the same field.
If there are update errors, they will be trapped in an error-handling routine. Filter the Recordset with the adFilterConflictingRecords constant so that only the conflicting rows are visible. In this example, the error-resolution strategy is merely to print the author's first and last names ( au_fname and au_lname ).
Before opening a Connection object, you must define certain information about the data source and type of connection. The ConnectionString parameter of the Connection object Open method — or the ConnectionString property on the Connection object — usually contains most of this information. A connection string is a string of characters that defines a variable number of arguments. The arguments — some required by ADO, but others provider-specific — contain information that the Connection object must have to carry out its work. The arguments that make up the ConnectionString parameter are separated with semicolons (;).
A set of functions for Internet servers, such as a Windows NT Server/Windows 2000 Server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).

RDS Object Model Summary | DataControl Object (RDS) | DataFactory Object (RDSServer) | DataSpace Object (RDS) | RDS Tutorial | Recordset Object | Using RDS
This example demonstrates how to create copies of a file using Stream or Record objects. One copy is made to a Web folder for Internet publishing. Other properties and methods shown include Stream Type , Open , LoadFromFile , and Record Open .
The Record object can also be used by semi-structured data providers such as the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing , to model tree-structured namespaces. Each node in the tree is a Record object with associated columns. The columns can represent the attributes of that node and other relevant information. The Record object can represent both a leaf node and a non-leaf node in the tree structure. Non-leaf nodes have other nodes as their contents while leaf nodes do not have such contents. Leaf nodes typically contain binary streams of data while non-leaf nodes may also have a default binary stream associated with them. Properties on the Record object identify the type of node.
The table below is a cross-index of the ADO and OLE DB names for each standard OLE DB provider dynamic property. Your providers may add more properties than listed here. For the specific information about provider-specific dynamic properties, see your provider documentation.
Moving information across the Internet and between software applications has always been difficult due to differences in data formats and proprietary structures.
An object supporting the OLE protocol for object linking and embedding.

Unsafe functions and properties are blocked only when used in expressions such as default values, control sources, or SQL statements. These are not blocked in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code.
Parameter queries that use named parameters maintain the original text name used in the Access database and are converted either to stored procedures or inline user-defined functions.
Each field is a fact about a particular subject. For example, you might need to store the following facts about your customers: company name, address, city, state, and phone number. You need to create a separate field for each of these facts. When determining which fields you need, keep these design principles in mind:
The replica set should have a large retention period if the replicas do not synchronize frequently.
For example, you could use the City field from the Employees table as a page field to view the sales performance by product category of just the sales representatives in London.

Join those tables on the fields that contain the related information.
Input masks are sets of placeholder and literal characters that control what users can enter into a field. You can apply input masks to fields in tables and query result sets, and to controls on forms and reports.
When you create a form or report and apply a filter before saving it for the first time, and then save it while the filter is still in effect, the filter cannot then be turned off. The form or report will always show the filtered view of the underlying table or query.
